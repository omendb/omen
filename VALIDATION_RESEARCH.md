# Market Validation Through Research - No Cold Calling Required

**Principle**: Use public data, competitor analysis, and existing market signals to validate opportunities.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è **PATH A: PostgreSQL Extension Validation**

### **Research Strategy**
1. **Analyze existing PostgreSQL extension market**
2. **Study competitor pricing and adoption**
3. **Review enterprise pain points from public sources**

### **Key Data Points to Research**

**Successful PostgreSQL Extensions:**
- **TimescaleDB**: $40M+ ARR, IPO-bound (time-series extension)
- **Citus Data**: Acquired by Microsoft for ~$75M (sharding extension)
- **PostGIS**: Massive adoption but monetized through services
- **pgvector**: Growing fast, Supabase integration (vector similarity)

**Research Questions:**
1. How much do enterprises pay for PostgreSQL performance improvements?
2. What's the adoption rate of performance-focused extensions?
3. How do successful extensions monetize?

**Data Sources:**
- Extension download stats from PostgreSQL.org
- GitHub stars/issues for popular extensions
- Job postings mentioning specific extensions
- Conference talks and adoption stories
- Vendor pricing pages (TimescaleDB, Crunchy Data)

**Success Indicators:**
- TimescaleDB proves enterprises pay $10K-100K for performance extensions
- pgvector shows rapid adoption is possible (10K+ stars in 2 years)
- Multiple consulting companies monetizing PostgreSQL performance

**Failure Indicators:**
- Most extensions remain free/open source only
- No clear enterprise monetization patterns
- Limited willingness to pay for incremental improvements

## üöÄ **PATH B: Specialized Database Validation**

### **Financial Trading Database Research**

**Target Companies to Study:**
- **Kx Systems** (kdb+): $100M+ revenue, used by all major banks
- **ClickHouse**: Yandex spinout, now $2B+ valuation
- **SingleStore**: $940M valuation, real-time analytics
- **Vertica**: Sold to HP for $340M, then Micro Focus

**Research Approach:**
1. **Job postings**: Search "financial trading database engineer" salaries/requirements
2. **Conference talks**: QCon, Strata, financial tech conferences
3. **GitHub issues**: Look at performance complaints in existing databases
4. **Engineering blogs**: Goldman Sachs, Jane Street, Two Sigma tech blogs
5. **Vendor case studies**: How much latency improvement is worth

**Key Research Questions:**
- What latency improvements do trading firms actually pay millions for?
- Which firms have built internal high-performance databases?
- What are the technical requirements beyond just speed?

**Public Data Sources:**
- **Jane Street tech talks**: They've discussed microsecond optimizations
- **Goldman Sachs engineering blog**: Database performance posts
- **High Frequency Trading forums**: Reddit, QuantNet discussions
- **Academic papers**: "Trading systems performance" research
- **Patents**: Search for trading database optimizations

### **Real-Time Analytics Market**

**Companies to Study:**
- **Datadog**: $5B+ revenue, real-time monitoring
- **New Relic**: $1B+ revenue, application monitoring
- **Splunk**: Multi-billion, log analytics
- **Elastic**: $1B+ revenue, search analytics

**Research Questions:**
- How much do these companies spend on database infrastructure?
- What performance bottlenecks do they publicly discuss?
- How much would 2x query speedup be worth to them?

## ‚ö° **PATH C: ML Infrastructure Validation**

### **GPU Training Market Research**

**Companies to Study:**
- **Modal**: $16M Series A for serverless ML infrastructure
- **Anyscale**: $260M raised, Ray ecosystem
- **RunPod**: $20M Series A, GPU cloud
- **Lambda Labs**: $44M Series B, GPU cloud
- **Paperspace**: Acquired by DigitalOcean

**Research Strategy:**
1. **Public spending data**: ML teams' GPU costs from engineering blogs
2. **Job postings**: "ML infrastructure engineer" requirements and pain points
3. **GitHub issues**: Training optimization problems
4. **Reddit/HN discussions**: ML engineers complaining about training costs
5. **Academic papers**: Training efficiency research
6. **Cloud pricing**: AWS/GCP GPU instance costs and usage patterns

**Key Data Points:**
- **OpenAI reportedly spends $50M+/month on compute**
- **Meta AI spends $10B+ annually on ML infrastructure**
- **Anthropic raised $300M partially for compute costs**
- **Average ML team at tech company**: $50K-500K/month on training

**Research Questions:**
- What percentage of ML budgets go to training vs inference?
- How much would 50% cost reduction be worth?
- What are the biggest training bottlenecks teams actually face?
- Which companies have built internal training optimization?

### **Public Pain Points to Research**
1. **Engineering blogs**: "How we reduced training costs by X%"
2. **Conference talks**: MLSys, NeurIPS infrastructure sessions
3. **GitHub repos**: Training optimization tools and their adoption
4. **Reddit r/MachineLearning**: Cost optimization discussions
5. **Twitter**: ML engineers complaining about GPU bills

4. **Financial modeling** based on public company data
5. **Technical feasibility** assessment for each path

### **Decision Framework:**
- **If database research shows clear enterprise demand**: Go database
- **If ML infrastructure shows massive opportunity**: Pivot to ML
- **If extension market is proven but limited**: Stay extension but bootstrap

### **Timeline:**
- **48 hours**: Complete research analysis
- **72 hours**: Write decision memo with recommendation
- **Week 1**: Begin execution on chosen path
