## The Honest Assessment

**Learned Database**: Solid, profitable business but not venture scale
**ML Infrastructure**: Highest upside but requires significant learning/investment
**Edge Computing**: Technical moat potential but massive infrastructure costs

**My Recommendation**:
1. **Give learned database 30 more days** of customer validation
2. **If no traction**: Pivot to ML infrastructure
3. **Hedge**: Start ML infrastructure research in parallel

The database work proves you can execute. ML infrastructure could be the venture-scale opportunity you're looking for.
