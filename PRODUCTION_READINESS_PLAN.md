## üí° Strategic Priorities

**Priority Order:**
1. **Stability First** - No crashes, proper errors (Tier 1)
2. **SQL Completeness** - JOINs, UPDATE, DELETE (Tier 2)
3. **Enterprise Features** - HA, monitoring, security (Tiers 3-4)
4. **Advanced Features** - Window functions, CTEs (Tier 3)

**Philosophy:**
- Better to do fewer things perfectly than many things poorly
- Production stability > feature count
- Real-world usage drives priorities
- Open source feedback loop
