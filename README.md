# OmenDB Server

**PostgreSQL-compatible vector database**

Drop-in replacement for pgvector. 10x faster, 28x more memory efficient. Source-available. Self-hostable.

---

## Quick Start

**Coming Soon** - Currently in development (Week 1: Vector prototype)

```sql
-- Coming soon: PostgreSQL-compatible wire protocol
CREATE TABLE documents (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  content TEXT,
  embedding vector(1536)
);

CREATE INDEX ON documents USING alex (embedding);

SELECT * FROM documents
ORDER BY embedding <-> '[0.1, 0.2, ...]'
LIMIT 10;
```

## Why OmenDB?

### vs pgvector (Current Standard)
- **10x faster** at 10M+ vectors
- **28x more memory efficient** (<2GB vs 60GB for 10M vectors)
- **Drop-in compatible** (PostgreSQL wire protocol)

### vs Pinecone (Popular Cloud)
- **90% cheaper** ($99 vs $500/month for 10M vectors)
- **Self-hostable** (compliance-friendly: HIPAA, SOC2, data sovereignty)
- **Source-available** (can verify, modify, contribute)
- **PostgreSQL-compatible** (no new API to learn)

### vs Weaviate/Qdrant (Vector Specialists)
- **PostgreSQL compatibility** (use existing tools, drivers, ORMs)
- **HTAP architecture** (one database for vectors + business data)
- **Learned indexing** (ALEX - 28x more memory efficient than B-trees)

## Technology

**ALEX Learned Indexing**:
- Multi-level hierarchical structure
- Predicts data location (vs tree traversal)
- 28x more memory efficient than traditional indexes
- Validated to 100M+ rows

**PostgreSQL Wire Protocol**:
- Drop-in replacement for pgvector
- Works with psql, pgcli, existing ORMs
- No new API to learn

**Production-Ready Stack**:
- MVCC snapshot isolation (concurrent operations)
- Crash recovery (100% success rate)
- Auth + SSL/TLS (enterprise-ready)
- RocksDB storage (LSM tree, write-optimized)

## Pricing

| Tier | Price | Vectors | Queries/mo | Best For |
|------|-------|---------|------------|----------|
| **Developer** | **FREE** | 100K | 100K | Prototyping, learning |
| **Starter** | **$29/mo** | 1M | 1M | Side projects, early startups |
| **Growth** | **$99/mo** | 10M | 10M | Production apps, scaling startups |
| **Enterprise** | **Custom** | Unlimited | Unlimited | Large deployments, compliance |

**Why this pricing wins**:
- **Predictable**: No surprise bills (vs Pinecone usage spikes)
- **Transparent**: Know your costs upfront
- **Competitive**: 90% cheaper than Pinecone
