## What We're Building

**Vision**: PostgreSQL-compatible vector database that's fast, memory-efficient, and embeddable.

**Technical Approach**:
- **HNSW index** for approximate nearest neighbor search
- **Binary Quantization** for memory efficiency
- **RocksDB storage** for persistence
- **PostgreSQL wire protocol** for compatibility
- **MVCC transactions** for concurrency

**Why This Matters**:
- pgvector doesn't scale beyond ~10M vectors
- Cloud vector DBs (Pinecone, etc.) are expensive and not self-hostable
- Most vector DBs have custom APIs (we use PostgreSQL protocol)

## Current Implementation

**What Works**:
- HNSW index implementation
- Binary Quantization for memory efficiency
- Graph serialization and persistence
- Parallel building
- Comprehensive test suite
- Memory safety validated

**What We're Working On**:
- Custom HNSW implementation (replacing library for better performance)
- SIMD optimizations
- Performance benchmarking vs alternatives
- PostgreSQL protocol integration
- Production hardening

**What's Not Ready**:
- No public release yet
- Performance optimization in progress
- API may change
- Documentation incomplete
- No migration tools yet

See [ai/STATUS.md](ai/STATUS.md) for detailed current status and roadmap.

## Research Foundation

This project implements ideas from recent research:

**Vector Indexing**:
- HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World graphs)
- Binary Quantization for memory efficiency
- RaBitQ (SIGMOD 2024) quantization

**Storage**:
- LSM trees (RocksDB)
- Learned data structures (future: seerdb)
- MVCC snapshot isolation

See [ai/research/](ai/research/) for detailed paper summaries and implementation notes.
