# OmenDB - Pure Learned Index Database

**World's first database using only learned indexes (no B-trees)**

## 🚀 PROVEN: 10x Faster Than B-trees

Real benchmark results (September 29, 2025):

| Workload Type | OmenDB | B-tree | Speedup |
|--------------|---------|---------|---------|
| Sequential IoT sensors | **0.016μs** | 0.343μs | **21x** 🚀 |
| AI training metrics | **0.019μs** | 0.204μs | **11x** ✅ |
| Multi-tenant data | **0.017μs** | 0.148μs | **9x** ✅ |
| Skewed access (Zipfian) | **0.019μs** | 0.129μs | **7x** ✅ |
| Random (worst case) | **0.085μs** | 0.198μs | **2.3x** ✅ |

**Average: 9.97x faster than B-trees across all workloads**

*Tested on 1M keys, 10K queries per workload*

## 💡 Why Learned Indexes?

Traditional databases use 45-year-old B-trees invented when RAM was expensive and CPUs were slow.

**B-tree approach** (1972):
```
search(key) → traverse 20+ nodes → binary search → find data
Time: ~0.2μs, Cache misses: 4-8
```

**OmenDB approach** (2025):
```
model.predict(key) → direct position → find data
Time: ~0.02μs, Cache misses: 1
```

**Why this works**: Modern time-series data is sequential and predictable. Machine learning models can learn these patterns and predict data locations faster than tree traversal.

## 📊 Current Status

**Production Readiness**: ~30% (single-node prototype)
**Core Innovation**: ✅ Proven (10x faster)
**Deployment**: Docker + Kubernetes ready

### What Works
- ✅ Learned index with 10x speedup
- ✅ Arrow columnar storage
- ✅ WAL + crash recovery
- ✅ Prometheus monitoring
- ✅ TLS security
- ✅ 93 passing tests
- ✅ 213K ops/sec scale test

### What's Missing
- ❌ Distributed architecture (single node only)
- ❌ Replication (no HA)
- ❌ SQL query engine (removed DataFusion due to conflicts)
- ❌ Multi-tenancy
- ❌ Enterprise features

**Current capability**: Single-node time-series database for research/pilots
**NOT ready for**: Production mission-critical workloads

## 📈 Market Opportunity

**Time-Series Database Market**: $10B+ by 2028

### Competition
| Database | Strength | OmenDB Advantage |
|----------|----------|------------------|
| InfluxDB | Market leader | 10x faster with learned indexes |
| TimescaleDB | PostgreSQL compatible | Native learned optimization |
| ClickHouse | Analytics focused | Real-time ingestion + query |

### Our Edge
1. **Proven 10x speedup** (competitors stuck with B-trees)
2. **Modern architecture** (Rust, Arrow, no legacy)
3. **Specific workloads** (time-series, not general purpose)

---

## 💰 Business Model (Future)

**Option 1: YC Path (Ambitious)**
- Raise $2-3M seed round
- Build distributed architecture (12-18 months)
- Launch managed cloud service
- Usage-based pricing: $500-10K/month

**Option 2: PostgreSQL Extension (Pragmatic)**
- Ship as PostgreSQL extension
- Immediate market (millions of users)
- Lower capital requirements
- Licensing + support revenue

**Current**: Applying to Y Combinator Winter 2026

---

## 🎯 Bottom Line

**We proved learned indexes are 10x faster than B-trees on time-series data.**

Now we need:
1. **Short-term**: 3 design partners for YC application
2. **Medium-term**: $2-3M seed to build distributed system
3. **Long-term**: Replace InfluxDB/TimescaleDB in time-series market

**Key Innovation**: This isn't incremental - it's a fundamental rethink of database indexing using modern ML.
