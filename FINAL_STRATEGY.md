# OmenDB Final Strategy - September 25, 2025

## The Decision: Build a Proprietary Learned Database

After extensive research and brutal self-assessment, here's the path forward:

### Business Model: Proprietary DBaaS
- **PostgreSQL Extension**: MIT licensed, pure marketing/validation tool
- **Standalone Database**: Fully proprietary (like Pinecone)
- **Revenue Model**: DBaaS subscriptions ($19-$700/month per customer)

### Why Proprietary Beats Open Source
1. **Pinecone**: $26.6M revenue, 4000 customers, zero open source
2. **MongoDB**: Even with SSPL, AWS still competes with DocumentDB
3. **Reality**: If you're successful, they'll clone you anyway
4. **Our Edge**: Being small means AWS won't notice us until $10M ARR

### Target Market: Time-Series Data
**Why Time-Series**:
- Predictable patterns perfect for learned indexes
- Growing market (IoT, monitoring, financial data)
- Clear performance requirements
- Competitors (TimescaleDB, InfluxDB) have weaknesses

**Initial Vertical**: Financial tick data
- Willing to pay $100K+ for microsecond improvements
- Small market but high value
- Technical buyers who understand performance

## Technical Architecture

### Storage Layer Strategy
Use proven storage engines (don't reinvent):
- **RocksDB**: For LSM-tree storage (Facebook-proven)
- **LMDB**: For B-tree storage (OpenLDAP-proven)
- **Our Innovation**: Learned index layer on top

### Performance Targets
- **10x faster** point queries vs PostgreSQL
- **5x faster** range queries
- **2x slower** writes (acceptable tradeoff)
- **Memory usage**: 10% of data size for models

### Killer Features
1. **Automatic model retraining** as data evolves
2. **Hybrid indexes**: Learned + traditional fallback
3. **Time-series optimized**: Built-in time partitioning
4. **PostgreSQL wire protocol**: Drop-in replacement

## Go-to-Market Strategy

### Phase 1: Technical Validation (Next 30 Days)
- Launch PostgreSQL extension on GitHub
- Target: 500 stars in first month
- Blog post: "We Made PostgreSQL 10x Faster"
- HackerNews launch

### Phase 2: Private Beta (Months 2-6)
- Build proprietary standalone database
- 10 beta customers (financial services)
- Focus on single use case perfection
- Gather performance data

### Phase 3: DBaaS Launch (Months 6-12)
- $19/month starter (like Neon)
- $199/month production
- $999/month enterprise
- Target: $10K MRR by month 12

---

## Competitive Positioning

### We Are NOT
- The next PostgreSQL (too ambitious)
- A general-purpose database (too broad)
- Open source heroes (too poor)

### We ARE
- The fastest database for time-series data
- 10x faster than TimescaleDB for reads
- Purpose-built for financial/IoT data
- The "Pinecone of time-series"

---

## Resource Requirements

### Absolute Minimum
- 18 months personal runway
- $0 external funding initially
- You coding 60+ hours/week
- Zero salary for 12 months

### Ideal Scenario
- Co-founder (database expertise)
- $500K seed funding
- 6-month runway before launch
- Part-time advisor from Neon/Supabase

---

## Success Metrics

### 30 Days
- [ ] 500 GitHub stars on extension
- [ ] 1 customer interview
- [ ] 1 blog post with >1000 views

### 6 Months
- [ ] 10 beta users
- [ ] Standalone database working
- [ ] 10x performance proven

### 12 Months
- [ ] $10K MRR
- [ ] 50 paying customers
- [ ] 99.9% uptime
- [ ] Ready for Series A or profitable

---

## Risk Mitigation

### If PostgreSQL adds learned indexes
**Response**: We're already 2 years ahead, focus on vertical features

### If nobody cares about performance
**Response**: Pivot to developer experience advantages

### If we run out of money
**Response**: Sell to Neon/Supabase as talent acquisition

### If technical approach fails
**Response**: Have failure criteria defined (if <5x speedup, stop)

---

## The Bottom Line

**Success Probability**: 25% (up from 20% with clearer strategy)

**Most Likely Outcome**:
- Small profitable business ($1-5M ARR)
- Or acquisition by larger database company

**Why Do It Anyway**:
- You've already built the technology
- Database expertise is valuable regardless
- Worst case: Great learning and connections
- Best case: $100M+ outcome

**Next Action**: Launch PostgreSQL extension publicly in next 7 days. If it gets traction, commit fully. If not, pivot to consulting or developer tools.
