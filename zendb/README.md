# ZenDB

**Experimental Multimodal Database Project**

> ⚠️ **Status**: Research project for future multimodal database. Currently on hold while we focus on OmenDB (vector database).

## 📊 Current State

ZenDB represents our research into building a sophisticated multimodal database combining:
- Relational SQL queries
- Vector search capabilities  
- Time-travel/versioning
- Disaggregated cloud-native architecture

**Test Status**: 61/70 tests passing (87% coverage)  
**Storage Engine**: Complete with B+Tree, MVCC, WAL, compression, multi-writer concurrency

## 🚀 Core Vision

**One Database, Every Scale**
- **Development**: Embedded mode with zero configuration  
- **Production**: Distributed cluster with automatic consensus
- **Edge**: WASM-compatible for serverless deployment
- **Mobile**: Offline-first with conflict-free synchronization
- **Time-Travel**: Debug production by querying the past
- **Real-Time**: Live dashboards without external infrastructure

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Hybrid Storage Engine
- **B+Tree Primary**: Predictable read performance for transactional workloads
- **LSM Write Buffer**: High-throughput write absorption for burst traffic
- **Adaptive Switching**: Automatic optimization based on workload patterns

### Zero-Copy MVCC
- Lock-free readers with hybrid logical clocks
- Optimistic concurrency control
- 100x better concurrent performance than SQLite

### Wire Protocol Compatibility
- **PostgreSQL Protocol**: Instant ecosystem compatibility
- **SQLite Migration**: Seamless upgrade path from existing applications
- **TypeScript Native**: Full type inference and auto-completion

## 🏭 What's Working

### Core Storage
- **B+Tree Engine**: Insert, search, delete, range scans
- **MVCC**: Multi-version concurrency control with HLC timestamps
- **WAL**: Write-ahead logging for crash recovery
- **Compression**: LZ4 compression (30-70% reduction)
- **Multi-Writer**: Page-level locking with deadlock detection

### Test Results

## 🎯 Target Use Cases

1. **SaaS Applications**: Multi-tenant isolation with row-level security
2. **Real-time Collaboration**: CRDT-based conflict resolution
3. **Edge Analytics**: Local aggregation with periodic cloud sync
4. **AI/ML Workloads**: Native vector operations and similarity search
5. **Developer Tools**: Zero-configuration embedded database

## 📊 Performance Goals

| Operation | Embedded Mode | Network Mode | Status |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|--------|
| Point Read | <50μs | <500μs | 🎯 Target |
| Range Scan (1K rows) | <1ms | <5ms | 🎯 Target |
| Single Insert | <100μs | <1ms | 🎯 Target |
| Bulk Insert | >500k/sec | >200k/sec | 🎯 Target |
| Concurrent Users | 10k+ | 100k+ | 🎯 Target |
