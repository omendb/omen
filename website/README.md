# OmenDB Website

Static website for OmenDB documentation and blog.

## Structure
- `blog/posts/` - Blog posts in Markdown
- `docs/` - Technical documentation
- `static/` - Images, CSS, etc.

## Building
We can use any static site generator:
- Zola (Rust-based)
- Hugo (fast)
- Next.js (if we need React)
- Or just serve the Markdown directly

## Deployment
- GitHub Pages
- Vercel
- Netlify

For now, the Markdown files are the source of truth.
