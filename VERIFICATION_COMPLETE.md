- ✅ Float special values (0.0, -0.0)
- ✅ Empty strings
- ✅ Very sparse keys (gaps of 1M+)
- ✅ Unsorted inserts
- ✅ Range query edge cases
- ✅ Non-existent tables

## 🐛 All Bugs Found & Fixed

### Bug #1: Negative Numbers Not Supported in INSERT ✅ FIXED
**Severity**: HIGH
**Impact**: Cannot insert negative values
**Root Cause**: SQL parser UnaryOp not handled
**Fix**: Added UnaryOp handling in expr_to_value()
**Lines**: src/sql_engine.rs:488-515

### Bug #2: i64::MIN Overflow ✅ FIXED
**Severity**: HIGH
**Impact**: Cannot insert i64::MIN
**Root Cause**: i64::MIN = i64::MAX + 1 causes overflow
**Fix**: Special case detection for i64::MIN
**Lines**: src/sql_engine.rs:495-498

### Bug #3: Negative Numbers in WHERE Clause ✅ FIXED
**Severity**: HIGH
**Impact**: Cannot query with negative WHERE values
**Root Cause**: evaluate_value_expr() didn't handle UnaryOp
**Fix**: Added UnaryOp handling in evaluate_value_expr()
**Lines**: src/sql_engine.rs:404-429

### Bug #4: Learned Index Broken at Scale (CRITICAL) ✅ FIXED
**Severity**: **CRITICAL** 🚨
**Impact**: **Learned index completely non-functional with large keys**
**Root Cause**: Floating-point precision loss with keys like 1.6e15
**Symptom**: Predicted model 8 for key at position 0 (should be model 0!)
**Fix**: Normalize keys to [0,1] during training, denormalize for use
**Lines**: src/index.rs:84-113
**Verification**: 50M keys test now passes (220ns avg)

### Bug #5: Search Window Size Limit ✅ FIXED
**Severity**: MEDIUM-HIGH
**Impact**: Returns None if search window > 16 elements
**Root Cause**: Arbitrary size limit in search_in_model()
**Fix**: Removed size limit, always binary search
**Lines**: src/index.rs:244-252

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### LLM Code Quality:
- ✅ **Good**: Overall architecture and structure
- ✅ **Good**: Error handling patterns
- ❌ **Bad**: Edge cases not handled
- ❌ **Bad**: Scale issues not considered
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: Core functionality broken at scale

### Verification Approach:
- ✅ **Systematic testing finds bugs**: 5 bugs found
- ✅ **Edge case testing crucial**: Found 3 bugs
- ✅ **Scale testing essential**: Found 2 critical bugs
- ✅ **SQL correctness testing valuable**: Verified operations
- ✅ **WAL testing important**: Confirmed durability

### Key Insight:
**LLM-generated code can look correct but have fundamental bugs.**
The learned index worked fine at small scale but was completely broken at 50M keys.
Without comprehensive verification, we would have shipped non-functional code.
