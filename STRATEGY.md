**Customer Pain**: 83% want real-time analytics, 70% stuck with batch ETL
**Unique Value**: Real-time analytics without ETL + intelligent data placement

## Market Opportunity

### ETL Elimination Market
- **Size**: $22.8B by 2032 (14.8% CAGR)
- **Pain Point**: Companies spend billions moving data between OLTP and OLAP
- **Latency**: Data is hours to days stale
- **Complexity**: Complex pipelines, data quality issues

### Streaming Analytics Market
- **Size**: $128.4B by 2030 (28.3% CAGR)
- **Growth Driver**: Real-time fraud detection, inventory, personalization
- **Gap**: Traditional ETL can't meet latency requirements

### Competition Analysis
| Company | Valuation | Approach | Weakness |
|---------|-----------|----------|----------|
| SingleStore | $1.35B | MySQL-compatible HTAP | Proprietary, expensive |
| TiDB | $3B | Distributed NewSQL | Complex deployment |
| Regatta | Early | Postgres-compatible HTAP | New, unproven |
| **OmenDB** | **Startup** | **Postgres + Arrow + Learned** | **Need to execute** |

```

### Technology Stack
- **Query Engine**: Apache DataFusion (Rust, Arrow-native)
- **Storage Format**: Apache Arrow/Parquet
- **Wire Protocol**: PostgreSQL-compatible
- **Learned Components**: Hot/cold placement, query routing
- **Language**: Rust for performance, safety

### Learned Index Integration
Instead of replacing traditional indexes, use them for:
1. **Hot/Cold Data Placement**: Predict which data will be queried
2. **Query Routing**: OLTP vs OLAP engine selection
3. **Cache Management**: Intelligent prefetching
4. **Storage Tiering**: Memory vs SSD vs object store

## Competitive Advantages

### 1. Zero ETL Architecture
- Real-time analytics on transactional data
- No data movement, no staleness
- Unified data model

### 2. PostgreSQL Compatibility
- Drop-in replacement for existing apps
- Massive ecosystem of drivers, tools
- Easy migration path

### 3. Learned Optimization
- Intelligent data placement
- Adaptive query routing
- Self-tuning performance

### 4. Modern Architecture
- Cloud-native Kubernetes deployment
- Elastic scaling (separate OLTP/OLAP compute)
- Arrow-based columnar processing

### 5. Open Core Business Model
- Core engine open source
- Managed service + enterprise features paid
- Community-driven development

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Validation (Weeks 1-3)
