# OmenDB Optimization Analysis

## Current Performance
- **1,400 vectors/second** single-threaded
- **0.54ms** search latency
- **288 bytes/vector** memory usage

## Optimizations Currently Active âœ…

### 1. Zero-Copy FFI
- NumPy arrays passed directly to Mojo without copying
- Using `unsafe_get_as_pointer[DType.float32]()`
- **Impact**: 5x speedup for batch operations

### 2. SIMD Distance Calculations
- Adaptive SIMD width (8-32 wide depending on hardware)
- Multi-accumulator strategy for large dimensions
- Hardware-aware selection (AVX2/AVX-512)
- **Impact**: 2-4x speedup on distance calculations

### 3. Memory Pool Allocation
- Pre-allocated vector storage
- No malloc/free during operations
- Fixed-size pool with fast indexing
- **Impact**: 10x reduction in allocation overhead

### 4. Binary Quantization (Ready but disabled)
- 32x memory reduction
- Can be re-enabled after fixing global state issue
- **Impact**: Would allow 32x more vectors in memory

## Available Optimizations Not Yet Implemented ðŸš€

### 1. Parallelize Operations (Partially implemented)
**Current Status**: 
- `parallelize` imported in multiple files
- `insert_bulk_wip()` exists but crashes at 5K+ vectors
- Matrix operations use parallelize for distance calculations

**Potential**: 
- **8-16x speedup** with proper parallelization
- Target: 10,000-20,000 vec/s single-node

**Blockers**:
- No thread synchronization primitives in Mojo
- Graph updates can't be safely parallelized
- Distance calculations ARE parallelized

### 2. GPU Support
**Current Status**: Not available in Mojo v25.4

**Potential**:
- **100x speedup** for distance calculations
- Target: 100,000+ vec/s

**Timeline**: Q3 2025 (Mojo roadmap)

### 3. Cache Optimization
**Not Implemented**:
- Prefetching for sequential access
- Cache-aligned data structures
- Hot/cold data separation

**Potential**: 20-30% speedup

### 4. HNSW Algorithm Optimizations
**Not Implemented**:
- Hierarchical graph pruning
- Dynamic ef_search adjustment
- Batch graph updates
- Lazy deletion

**Potential**: 2-3x speedup

### 5. Memory Layout Optimizations
**Not Implemented**:
- Structure of Arrays (SoA) instead of Array of Structures
- Columnar storage for better cache utilization
- Compressed graph edges

**Potential**: 30-50% speedup

### 6. Vectorized Batch Operations
**Partially Implemented**:
- Single vector operations optimized
- Batch-to-batch distance calculations not optimized

**Potential**: 2-4x speedup for batch operations

### 7. Assembly-Level Optimizations
**Not Implemented**:
- Hand-tuned AVX-512 kernels
- Platform-specific optimizations
- Inline assembly for critical paths

**Potential**: 20-40% speedup

## Maximum Potential with Current Architecture

### Single-Thread Theoretical Maximum
With all CPU optimizations (no GPU):
- **Target**: 10,000-15,000 vec/s
- **Search**: <0.1ms latency
- **Memory**: 100 bytes/vector with compression

## Immediate Optimization Opportunities

### 1. Better SIMD Utilization
```mojo
# Current: Generic SIMD
fn distance(a: UnsafePointer[Float32], b: UnsafePointer[Float32], d: Int) -> Float32

# Optimized: Specialized kernels
fn distance_128d_avx512(a: UnsafePointer[Float32], b: UnsafePointer[Float32]) -> Float32
fn distance_256d_avx512(a: UnsafePointer[Float32], b: UnsafePointer[Float32]) -> Float32
fn distance_768d_avx512(a: UnsafePointer[Float32], b: UnsafePointer[Float32]) -> Float32
```

### 2. Prefetching
```mojo
# Add prefetching for sequential access
@always_inline
fn prefetch_vector(ptr: UnsafePointer[Float32], offset: Int):
    __builtin_prefetch(ptr + offset, 0, 3)  # If available in Mojo
```

### 3. Loop Unrolling
```mojo
# Manual unrolling for critical loops
for i in range(0, dimension, 4):
    sum += (a[i] - b[i]) ** 2
    sum += (a[i+1] - b[i+1]) ** 2
    sum += (a[i+2] - b[i+2]) ** 2
    sum += (a[i+3] - b[i+3]) ** 2
```

### 4. Memory Alignment
```mojo
# Ensure 64-byte alignment for cache lines
var aligned_ptr = UnsafePointer[Float32].alloc(size, alignment=64)
```

## Python Interop Current State

### Working Well âœ…
- Zero-copy NumPy arrays
- Direct memory access via ctypes
- Automatic dtype conversion
- Metadata dictionaries

### Limitations ðŸ”§
- Can't return complex Python objects efficiently
- Dict iteration is limited
- No direct PyTorch/TensorFlow tensor support yet

### Potential Improvements
- Add PyTorch tensor zero-copy
- Support TensorFlow tensors
- Better metadata handling
- Streaming results for large queries

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Immediate** (This week):
   - Implement specialized SIMD kernels for common dimensions
   - Add prefetching where possible
   - Optimize memory alignment

2. **Short-term** (Next month):
   - Fix global state to enable binary quantization
   - Implement cache-aware data structures
   - Add batch distance matrix operations

3. **Medium-term** (Q1 2025):
   - Wait for Mojo thread primitives
   - Implement full parallelization
   - Add hierarchical graph optimizations

4. **Long-term** (Q3 2025):
   - GPU support when available
   - Distributed computing
   - Hardware-specific optimizations

## Conclusion

We're currently using **~10%** of the potential performance:
- Current: 1,400 vec/s
- Achievable (CPU): 10,000-15,000 vec/s  
- Future (GPU): 100,000+ vec/s

The biggest blockers are:
1. Mojo's lack of thread synchronization (prevents parallelization)
2. Global state management (prevents multiple instances)
3. No GPU support yet

But even single-threaded, we can achieve **7-10x** improvement with:
- Specialized SIMD kernels
- Cache optimization
- Memory layout improvements
- Algorithm optimizations
