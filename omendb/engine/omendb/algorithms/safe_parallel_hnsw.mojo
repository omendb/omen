Safe Parallel HNSW Implementation
September 2025

Fixes memory corruption in parallel execution using:
1. Pre-allocated memory regions (no runtime allocation in parallel)
2. Read-only shared data (no writes to shared memory during parallel phase)
3. Single-writer pattern (only main thread writes final results)

Key insight: Current crashes are due to concurrent writes to shared HNSWIndex.
Solution: Separate computation from coordination.
