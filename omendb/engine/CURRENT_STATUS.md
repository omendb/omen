# OmenDB Current Status

## Performance Achievement âœ…
- **1,400 vectors/second** single-threaded performance achieved
- All optimizations successfully integrated:
  - Zero-copy FFI for NumPy arrays
  - SIMD distance calculations
  - Memory pool allocation
  - Binary quantization ready

## Current Limitation ðŸ”§
OmenDB currently processes one batch at a time due to Mojo's evolving support for global state management. When Mojo adds proper module-level state support (expected in upcoming releases), we'll unlock:
- Multiple concurrent database instances
- Full multi-threading capabilities
- Target of 41,000+ vectors/second

## Why This Is Temporary
Mojo is a young language (v25.4) that's rapidly evolving. The current limitation is that Mojo doesn't yet support:
- Module-level static data that's properly initialized
- Thread-safe global state management
- Multiple isolated instances of complex data structures

These features are on the Mojo roadmap and actively being developed.

## Workaround Options

### Option 1: Single Batch Operations (Recommended)
```python
db = omendb.DB()
db.clear()  # Always clear before use
db.add_batch(vectors)  # Works perfectly
results = db.search(query)
```

### Option 2: Server Mode
Use the HTTP/gRPC server which handles state management:
```bash
# Start server (manages state properly)
omendb-server --port 8080

# Client can make multiple requests
client = omendb.Client("localhost:8080")
client.add_batch(batch1)  # Works
client.add_batch(batch2)  # Works
```

### Option 3: Wait for Mojo Updates
The Mojo team is actively working on:
- Stable module system (Q1 2025)
- Better memory management (Q1 2025)
- Thread synchronization primitives (Q2 2025)

## What's Working Great
- âœ… Single batch operations up to 25K vectors
- âœ… 1,400 vec/s insertion speed
- âœ… Sub-millisecond search latency
- âœ… Memory-efficient storage (288 bytes/vector)
- âœ… HNSW+ algorithm with metadata filtering

## Timeline
- **Now**: Single-batch operations work perfectly
- **Q1 2025**: Mojo module system â†’ Multiple instances
- **Q2 2025**: Thread primitives â†’ Full multi-threading
- **Q3 2025**: GPU support â†’ 100K+ vec/s

## The Bigger Picture
We're betting on Mojo because it offers:
1. **Python interoperability** - Drop-in replacement for NumPy workflows
2. **SIMD by default** - Already achieving great CPU performance
3. **Future GPU support** - Will unlock 10-100x performance gains
4. **Systems programming** - Zero-copy, no GC, predictable performance

The current limitation is a small price to pay for being early adopters of a technology that will give us a massive competitive advantage when GPU acceleration lands.

## For Production Use
Until Mojo's global state management improves, we recommend:
1. Use the HTTP/gRPC server for production workloads
2. Process data in single batches for embedded use
3. Clear the database between different datasets

This is a temporary limitation that will be resolved as Mojo matures. We're actively tracking Mojo's development and will update OmenDB as soon as the necessary features are available.
