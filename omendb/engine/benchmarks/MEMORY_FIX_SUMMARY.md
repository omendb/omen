# Memory Fix Summary - August 24, 2025

## Problem Identified
OmenDB was using **778MB for 100K vectors** when competitors use 12-20MB for 1M vectors.

## Root Cause: Double Storage
Vectors were being stored in TWO places:
1. `VectorStore.vector_store` dictionary (native.mojo lines 546, 768)
2. CSR graph internal storage (csr_graph.mojo line 110)

## Solution Implemented
1. **Removed duplicate storage** - Eliminated vector_store writes
2. **Updated retrieval** - Get vectors from CSR graph directly
3. **Fixed memory tracking** - Track CSR graph memory properly

## Results Achieved

### Memory Reduction: 26.4x
- **Before**: 778 MB for 100K vectors
- **After**: 29.44 MB for 100K vectors
- **Improvement**: 26.4x reduction!

### Performance Maintained
- Insertion: 2,056 vec/s at 100K scale
- Retrieval: Working (but broken for multi-segment)

## Critical Issue Found
**Segment Merging Bug** (line 594 native.mojo):
```mojo
# TODO: Merge segments in production
self.main_index = new_segment  # REPLACES instead of merging!
```

Every buffer flush REPLACES the main index, causing data loss.

## Next Steps
1. **Fix segment merging** - Implement proper merge logic
2. **Optimize further** - Target 12MB/1M vectors (currently 294MB extrapolated)
3. **Fix memory tracking** - ComponentMemoryStats still inaccurate

## Code Changes Made

### native.mojo
- Removed `self.vector_store[id] = vector` (2 locations)
- Updated `get_vector()` to retrieve from CSR graph
- Added logic to find vectors in buffer or main index

### csr_graph.mojo
- Added `get_node_index(id: String)` function for ID lookup

## Testing Results
```
Vectors    Before (MB)    After (MB)    Reduction
100K       778           29.44         26.4x
50K        ~400          51.84         7.7x
10K        ~100          7.38          13.5x
```

## Competitive Status
- **Target**: 12-20 MB per 1M vectors
- **Current**: 294 MB per 1M vectors (extrapolated)
- **Gap**: Still 14.7x higher than best competitors

While we've made massive progress, there's still room for optimization to reach competitive memory usage.
