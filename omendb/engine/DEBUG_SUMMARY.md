# Binary Quantization Debug Summary

## Investigation Timeline

### Initial State
- System crashed at vector 10 when binary quantization was enabled
- Error: Segmentation fault during neighbor search

### Root Cause Analysis

#### Issue 1: Dimension Mismatch (FIXED ✅)
**Problem:** Dummy BinaryQuantizedVector objects were created with dimension=1 instead of 768
**Location:** `enable_binary_quantization()` and `_insert_node()` functions
**Impact:** Caused segfault in `hamming_distance()` when comparing 768-dim query with 1-dim dummy
**Fix:** All dummy vectors now use correct dimension (self.dimension)

#### Issue 2: Uniform Vector Handling (FIXED ✅)
**Problem:** Uniform vectors (all ones/zeros) created all-zero bit patterns
**Location:** `BinaryQuantizedVector.__init__()` threshold calculation
**Impact:** All-zero patterns broke HNSW search logic
**Fix:** Alternating bit pattern for uniform vectors

### Current Status

#### Achievements
- Fixed dimension mismatch - vectors 0-10 now work with binary quantization
- Improved uniform vector handling
- Identified deeper issues in base HNSW

#### Remaining Issues
1. **Base HNSW Issue:** System crashes at vector 4-5 even WITHOUT binary quantization
   - Suggests fundamental memory management issue
   - Likely in NodePool or connection handling
   
2. **Bus Error:** Vector 11+ causes bus error with binary quantization
   - Different from segfault - indicates memory alignment issue
   - Only occurs after base issues compound

## Test Results

### Single Vector Tests
```
✅ Individual vectors work when database cleared between
✅ All patterns (ones, zeros, random) work individually
```

### Accumulation Tests
```
❌ Base HNSW: Crashes at vector 4-5
❌ With Binary Quantization: Crashes at vector 10-11
```

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Base HNSW Issues First**
   - Debug memory management in NodePool
   - Check connection array bounds
   - Verify visited array handling

2. **Then Fix Binary Quantization Bus Error**
   - Check memory alignment requirements
   - Verify SIMD operations alignment

3. **Finally Re-enable Optimizations**
   - Hub Highway architecture
   - Smart distance calculation
   - Cache-friendly layout

## Code Changes Made

### Files Modified
- `omendb/algorithms/hnsw.mojo` - Fixed dummy vector dimensions
- `omendb/compression/binary.mojo` - Fixed uniform vector threshold
- `omendb/native.mojo` - Temporarily disabled binary quantization

### Key Fixes
```mojo
// Before: Dimension mismatch
var empty_vec = BinaryQuantizedVector(dummy_vec, 1)  // WRONG!

// After: Correct dimension
var empty_vec = BinaryQuantizedVector(dummy_vec, self.dimension)  // FIXED!
```

## Debugging Commands

```bash
# Build
pixi run mojo build omendb/native.mojo -o python/omendb/native.so --emit shared-lib

# Test
python test_minimal.py  # Basic functionality
python test_scale.py    # Scale testing
python test_precise.py  # Find exact failure point
```

## Conclusion

We've made significant progress fixing the binary quantization dimension issues, but uncovered deeper problems in the base HNSW implementation that need to be resolved first. The system is not yet production-ready but we have a clear path forward.
