**Revenue Target**: $150K ARR from 50 Pro + 10 Enterprise customers

### **Phase 3: Server Mode (Year 2)**
**Target**: Distributed deployment and managed services

**Revenue Model**: Self-Hosted + Managed
- **Server License**: $2,999/year per cluster
- **Managed Service**: $299-999/month per cluster

**Revenue Target**: $500K Annual Revenue Run Rate

### **Phase 4: PaaS Platform (Year 3+)**
**Target**: Full SaaS platform competing with Pinecone

**Revenue Model**: Usage-Based SaaS
- **Starter**: $29/month (100K vectors)
- **Growth**: $199/month (1M vectors)
- **Scale**: $999/month (10M vectors)

**Revenue Target**: $2M+ Annual Revenue Run Rate

## ðŸš€ **Current Focus (Phase 1)**

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Complete RoarGraph optimization** - Achieve <10ms search for 100K vectors
2. **Performance benchmarking** - Validate 5-10x advantage over competitors  
3. **Production hardening** - Ensure reliability for production deployments
4. **Documentation and examples** - Drive organic adoption

### Success Definition
- Technical superiority established (benchmarks, papers, demos)
- Strong community adoption (GitHub metrics, user testimonials)
- Foundation for monetization (user base, performance advantage)

## ðŸ’° **Competitive Positioning**

**vs ChromaDB**: Better performance, smaller storage, embedded deployment
**vs Pinecone**: Lower cost, on-premise deployment, no vendor lock-in
**vs Qdrant**: Better algorithms, embedded option, simpler deployment

**Moat**: RoarGraph algorithm advantage + embedded-first architecture + storage efficiency
