## Competitive Differentiation

### vs. SQLite
- **Better**: 100× concurrent performance, distributed scaling, time-travel
- **Worse**: Slightly larger binary size, more complex initially
- **Unique**: Real-time subscriptions, schema-as-code migrations

### vs. PostgreSQL
- **Better**: Embedded mode, time-travel queries, auto-tuning hybrid storage
- **Worse**: Newer codebase, smaller ecosystem initially
- **Unique**: Embedded→distributed scaling, framework integration

### vs. Firebase/Supabase
- **Better**: Full SQL support, better performance, no vendor lock-in
- **Worse**: More setup initially, smaller real-time ecosystem
- **Unique**: Time-travel debugging, true ACID transactions

### vs. Vector Databases (Pinecone, Weaviate)
- **Better**: Unified relational+vector transactions, SQL familiarity
- **Worse**: Specialized vector features, query optimization
- **Unique**: Multi-modal ACID transactions, conventional SQL interface

## Partnership Strategy

### Technology Partners
- **Cloud Providers**: AWS/GCP/Azure marketplace listings
- **Platform-as-a-Service**: Railway, Render, Fly.io native integrations  
- **Monitoring**: DataDog, Prometheus native connectors
