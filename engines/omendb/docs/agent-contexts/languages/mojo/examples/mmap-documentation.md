# TITLE: Mojo mmap Module
# VERSION: Proposal
# COMPATIBILITY: Mojo runtime
# DOCUMENTATION_SOURCE: Stdlib Proposal for mmap
# MODEL: Claude-3.7-Sonnet

## Conceptual Overview

- **Memory Mapping Utility**: Provides an API for mapping files directly into memory, enabling faster I/O operations with reduced system calls
- **Performance Enhancement**: Offers significant performance benefits for random access on large files through demand paging
- **Memory Sharing**: Enables multiple processes to efficiently share memory
- **Configurable Access Modes**: Supports different memory protection modes including read-only, write, and execute
- **File-System Integration**: Works with the existing Mojo file system APIs

## Technical Reference

### MmapMode [`EXPERIMENTAL`]

**Package:** `mmap`
**Available Since:** Proposal
**Status:** Experimental

**Signature:**
```mojo
struct MmapMode:
    alias READ: String = "READ"
    alias WRITE: String = "WRITE"
    alias EXEC: String = "EXEC"
    alias COW: String = "COW"  # Copy On Write
```

**Dependencies/Imports:**
```mojo
from mmap import MmapMode
```

**Usage Example:**
```mojo
# Use one of the predefined memory mapping modes
var mode = MmapMode.READ  # Read-only access
```

**Context:**
- Purpose: Defines protection and access modes for memory mapped files
- Patterns: Used as an enum-like parameter when creating Mmap objects
- Alternatives: Direct specification of protection and flags values
- Related: Used by the Mmap constructor to determine system-specific protection and flag values

### Mmap [`EXPERIMENTAL`]

**Package:** `mmap`
**Available Since:** Proposal
**Status:** Experimental

**Signature:**
```mojo
struct Mmap:
    var pointer: UnsafePointer[UInt8]
    var length: Int32
    var offset: Int32
    var mode: String
    
    @staticmethod
    fn _get_prot(mode: String) raises -> Int32
    
    @staticmethod
    fn _get_flags(mode: String) raises -> Int32
    
    fn __init__(inout self, fd: FileDescriptor, length: Int32, offset: Int32, 
                mode: String, address: UnsafePointer[UInt8] = UnsafePointer[UInt8]()) raises
                
    fn __init__(inout self, length: Int32, offset: Int32, 
                mode: String, address: UnsafePointer[UInt8] = UnsafePointer[UInt8]()) raises
                
    fn close(inout self) raises
    
    fn read_bytes(inout self, owned size: Int32 = -1) raises -> List[UInt8]
    
    fn write(inout self, data: String) raises
    
    fn seek(inout self, size: Int32) raises
```

**Dependencies/Imports:**
```mojo
from mmap import Mmap, MmapMode
```

**Usage Example:**
```mojo
# Read-only mapping example
var fd: FileDescriptor = open("./test.txt", "r")
var length: Int32 = 24
var mmap = Mmap(fd=fd, length=length, offset=0, mode=MmapMode.READ)

# Read the entire file as a String
print(String(mmap.read_bytes()))

# Memory mapped files must be closed to prevent memory leaks
mmap.close()
```

```mojo
# Read-write mapping example
var fd: FileDescriptor = open("./test.txt", "r+")
var length: Int32 = 24
var mmap = Mmap(fd=fd, length=length, offset=0, mode=MmapMode.WRITE)

# Print the current content
print(String(mmap.read_bytes()))

# Write new content to the mapped file
mmap.write("hello world")

# Close the mapping
mmap.close()
```

**Context:**
- Purpose: Provides an interface for memory-mapped file I/O
- Patterns: Uses demand paging for efficient random access on large files
- Alternatives: Traditional file I/O using read/write operations
- Limitations: 
  - Requires careful management to avoid memory leaks
  - Requires proper file permissions matching the requested mapping mode
- Related: Works with `FileDescriptor` from the file system API
- Behavior: 
  - Thread-safe for reading from read-only mappings
  - Multiple processes can share the same mapping for IPC
  - Maps file contents directly into memory address space

**Edge Cases and Anti-patterns:**

```mojo
# ANTI-PATTERN: Not closing the memory map
var mmap = Mmap(fd=fd, length=length, offset=0, mode=MmapMode.READ)
# ... use the mapping ...
# Missing mmap.close() - will lead to resource leaks

# CORRECT:
var mmap = Mmap(fd=fd, length=length, offset=0, mode=MmapMode.READ)
# ... use the mapping ...
mmap.close()  # Always close the mapping when done
```

```mojo
# ANTI-PATTERN: Accessing a closed memory map
mmap.close()
print(String(mmap.read_bytes()))  # Will raise an exception as the map is closed

# CORRECT:
# Keep the mapping open until all operations are complete
print(String(mmap.read_bytes()))
mmap.close()
```

```mojo
# ANTI-PATTERN: Incorrect file permissions for mapping mode
var fd = open("./test.txt", "r")  # Read-only file descriptor
var mmap = Mmap(fd=fd, length=24, offset=0, mode=MmapMode.WRITE)  # Will fail

# CORRECT:
var fd = open("./test.txt", "r+")  # Read-write file descriptor
var mmap = Mmap(fd=fd, length=24, offset=0, mode=MmapMode.WRITE)
```

**Implementation Details:**

The implementation leverages system calls to the underlying OS memory mapping facilities:

1. Page Size Calculation:
```mojo
fn page_size() -> Int32:
    return external_call["getpagesize", Int32]()
```

2. Initialization with Page Alignment:
```mojo
fn __init__(inout self, fd: FileDescriptor, length: Int32, offset: Int32, mode: String, 
           address: UnsafePointer[UInt8] = UnsafePointer[UInt8]()) raises:
    
    # Calculate appropriate arguments with proper page alignment
    var alignment = offset % page_size()
    var aligned_offset = offset - alignment
    var aligned_len = length + alignment
    
    var pointer = external_call["mmap", UnsafePointer[UInt8], UnsafePointer[UInt8], 
                              Int32, Int32, Int32, Int32, Int32](
        address,
        aligned_len,
        self._get_prot(mode),
        self._get_flags(mode),
        fd.value,
        aligned_offset
    )
    
    if pointer < UnsafePointer[UInt8]():
        raise "unable to mmap file"
    
    self.pointer = pointer
    self.length = aligned_len
    self.offset = offset
    self.mode = mode
```

3. Memory Release:
```mojo
fn close(inout self) raises:
    var err = external_call["munmap", Int32, UnsafePointer[UInt8], Int32](
        self.pointer, self.length
    )
    if err != 0:
        raise "unable to close mmap"
    else:
        self.mode = MmapMode.CLOSED
```

## Advanced Usage

### Anonymous Memory Mapping

Memory mapping is not limited to files. Anonymous mappings can be created for inter-process shared memory:

```mojo
# Create an anonymous memory mapping of 4096 bytes
var length: Int32 = 4096
var mmap = Mmap(length=length, offset=0, mode=MmapMode.WRITE)

# Use the memory mapping
mmap.write("data to be shared between processes")

# Close when done
mmap.close()
```

### Performance Considerations

- Memory mapping is most beneficial for large files with random access patterns
- For sequential access on small files, traditional I/O may be more efficient
- Mapping very large files requires careful consideration of address space constraints
- Page faults occur when accessing unmapped pages, which can impact performance if access patterns are not optimized

### Security Considerations

- Proper file permissions are essential for security
- Be cautious with EXEC mappings as they can execute code
- When mapping files from untrusted sources, use READ mode to prevent modifications
- For multi-process scenarios, consider using Copy-On-Write (COW) to prevent one process from modifying another's memory

## Implementation Notes

The implementation uses the following system-specific constants:

```mojo
alias PROT_READ: Int32 = 1    # Page can be read
alias MAP_SHARED: Int32 = 0x01  # Share changes with other processes
```

Additional protection modes to be implemented:

```mojo
alias PROT_WRITE: Int32 = 2    # Page can be written
alias PROT_EXEC: Int32 = 4     # Page can be executed
alias PROT_NONE: Int32 = 0     # Page cannot be accessed
```

Additional mapping flags to be implemented:

```mojo
alias MAP_PRIVATE: Int32 = 0x02  # Changes are private (copy-on-write)
alias MAP_ANONYMOUS: Int32 = 0x20  # Don't use a file descriptor
```
