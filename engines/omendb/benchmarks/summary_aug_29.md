# OmenDB Progress Summary - August 29, 2025

## Executive Summary
Made significant progress identifying and fixing critical issues in OmenDB. Quantization is now functional after switching graph implementations, and the 10K performance cliff has been identified and temporarily mitigated. However, a new critical issue prevents scaling beyond 20K vectors.

## Major Achievements

### 1. ✅ Quantization Fixed
**Problem**: Quantization was completely broken - using MORE memory than normal vectors

**Root Cause Discovery**:
- Two competing graph implementations existed:
  - `MMapGraph`: Had `use_quantization` flag but NO implementation (fake!)
  - `VamanaGraph` (CSRGraph): Has full working quantization

**Solution Applied**:
- Switched DiskANN from MMapGraph to VamanaGraph
- Changed: `from ..core.mmap_graph import MMapGraph` → `from ..core.csr_graph import VamanaGraph`
- Result: Quantization now enables and works functionally

**Remaining**: Memory optimization needed (still ~2KB/vector, target is 136 bytes)

### 2. ✅ Performance Cliff Identified & Mitigated
**Problem**: Performance dropped 10x at exactly 10K vectors (95K → 10K vec/s)

**Root Cause Discovery**:
- Buffer flush at 10K boundary adds vectors one-by-one to DiskANN
- Each add() involves expensive graph operations (search, connect, prune)
- Measured: 39ms per 100 vectors = ~4 seconds for 10K vectors!

**Quick Fix Applied**:
- Increased default buffer_size from 10,000 to 100,000
- Changed in: `python/omendb/api.py` line 194
- Result: Performance cliff delayed to 100K vectors

**Proper Fix Needed**: Implement batch flush instead of one-by-one insertion

### 3. ❌ New Critical Issue Found
**Problem**: VamanaGraph crashes with segfault at ~20K vectors

**Impact**: 
- Can't test at production scale
- Blocks all other optimization work
- Makes database unusable beyond toy datasets

**Priority**: MUST FIX before any other work

## Code Changes Made

### 1. Graph Implementation Switch
```mojo
// omendb/algorithms/diskann.mojo
- from ..core.mmap_graph import MMapGraph
+ from ..core.csr_graph import VamanaGraph

- var graph: MMapGraph  
+ var graph: VamanaGraph
```

### 2. Buffer Size Increase
```python
# python/omendb/api.py
- buffer_size: int = 10000,
+ buffer_size: int = 100000,  # Increased from 10000 to avoid performance cliff
```

### 3. Double Storage Fix
```mojo
// native.mojo - Removed duplicate storage
- self.vector_store[id] = vector  # Removed this everywhere
// Vectors now only stored in graph structure
```

## Performance Metrics

### Before Fixes
- Quantization: Completely broken (used MORE memory)
- 10K cliff: 95K → 10K vec/s (10x degradation)
- Scale limit: 10K vectors

### After Fixes
- Quantization: Functional (but memory optimization needed)
- 100K cliff: Performance maintained up to 100K (then same issue)
- Scale limit: ~20K vectors (crashes with segfault)

## Next Priority Tasks

1. **Fix VamanaGraph crash at 20K vectors**
   - Debug memory management in CSRGraph
   - Use valgrind or AddressSanitizer
   - This blocks all other work

2. **Implement proper batch flush**
   - Replace one-by-one insertion with batch operation
   - Target: <1ms per 100 vectors (currently 39ms)

3. **Optimize quantization memory usage**
   - Current: ~2KB/vector (no savings)
   - Target: 136 bytes/vector (128 uint8 + 8 metadata)

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always verify implementations** - MMapGraph had the interface but no implementation
2. **Test at scale** - Issues only appear at 10K+ vectors
3. **Profile actual operations** - Buffer flush was 100x slower than expected
4. **Quick fixes buy time** - Increasing buffer size gave temporary relief

## Production Readiness: 4/10

### What Works
- Quantization enables correctly
- Performance good up to buffer limit
- Core algorithm is sound

### What's Broken
- Crashes at 20K vectors
- Memory usage still too high
- Batch operations needed

## Files Modified
- `/omendb/algorithms/diskann.mojo` - Switched to VamanaGraph
- `/omendb/core/csr_graph.mojo` - Added compatibility methods
- `/omendb/native.mojo` - Removed double storage
- `/python/omendb/api.py` - Increased buffer size
- Documentation updated in `/omendb-cloud/docs/`

## Time Spent
- Graph investigation: 2 hours
- Performance cliff diagnosis: 1.5 hours  
- Fixes and testing: 2 hours
- Documentation: 0.5 hours

Total: ~6 hours of focused debugging and fixes

*End of day status: Major progress made, but VamanaGraph crash at 20K is the critical blocker for v0.0.1*
