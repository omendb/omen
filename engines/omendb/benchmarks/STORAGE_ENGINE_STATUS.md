# Storage Engine Status Report

## Executive Summary

After comprehensive audit and testing, found multiple critical issues:

1. **Memory-Mapped Storage**: Write works, recovery NOT IMPLEMENTED (TODO stubs)
2. **Vector Normalization**: Changes user data without consent
3. **Quantization**: Flags set but never applied
4. **Memory Tracking**: Off by 1476%

## Detailed Findings

### 1. ‚úÖ FIXED: Double Storage (26.4x memory reduction)
- **Problem**: Vectors stored in both dict and CSR graph
- **Solution**: Removed dict storage, retrieve from CSR only
- **Result**: 778MB ‚Üí 29MB for 100K vectors

### 2. ‚úÖ FIXED: Segment Merging
- **Problem**: Each flush replaced index causing duplicates
- **Solution**: Implemented proper merge logic
- **Result**: Count now accurate, no data loss

### 3. ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL: Memory-Mapped Storage
- **Problem**: Recovery returns 0 vectors
- **Root Cause**: _load_vector_blocks() is a TODO stub!
```mojo
fn _load_vector_blocks(mut self) -> Int:
    """Load vector blocks from memory-mapped storage."""
    # TODO: Implement block loading logic
    return 0
```
- **Status**: Write path works, recovery not implemented
- **Impact**: Persistence completely broken

### 4. üî¥ CRITICAL: Vector Normalization
- **Problem**: Vectors normalized in CSR graph storage
- **Location**: csr_graph.mojo line 110
```mojo
self.vectors[start_idx + i] = vector[i] * inv_norm
```
- **Impact**: Users get different values than stored
- **Fix Needed**: Store both original and normalized

### 5. üî¥ CRITICAL: Quantization Not Applied
- **Problem**: Flags default to False, never applied
- **Location**: native.mojo lines 140, 142
```mojo
self.use_quantization = False
self.use_binary_quantization = False  
```
- **Impact**: Missing 4-32x memory savings
- **Fix Needed**: Apply when enabled

### 6. ‚ö†Ô∏è Memory Tracking Inaccurate
- **Problem**: Reports 10MB when actual is 0.66MB
- **Root Cause**: Incorrect accumulation, missing CSR graph tracking
- **Impact**: Can't trust metrics

## Code Quality Issues

### Incomplete Implementations
- Memory-mapped recovery (TODO stub)
- Block loading logic (TODO stub)
- Graph block loading (TODO stub)
- Efficient block search (TODO stub)

### Integration Issues
- Quantization flags not integrated with add path
- CSR graph memory_bytes() not called
- Original vectors not stored after double storage fix

### Design Issues
- Normalization not documented or optional
- No way to retrieve original vectors
- Memory tracking has multiple sources of truth

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Critical Data Loss)
1. **Implement memory-mapped recovery functions**
   - _load_vector_blocks()
   - _load_graph_blocks()
   - _load_from_blocks()
2. **Fix vector normalization**
   - Store originals separately
   - Or make normalization optional
3. **Apply quantization when enabled**
   - Check flags in add path
   - Store quantized versions

### Short Term (Functionality)
1. Fix memory tracking accuracy
2. Add integration tests
3. Document normalization behavior

### Long Term (Architecture)
1. Complete memory-mapped storage implementation
2. Redesign vector storage for original + normalized
3. Centralize memory tracking

## Current State Assessment

### What Works
- Basic add/search operations
- Buffer to index flushing  
- Segment merging
- Memory-mapped write path

### What's Broken
- Persistence (recovery not implemented)
- Quantization (not applied)
- Vector values (normalized without consent)
- Memory tracking (wildly inaccurate)

### Performance Impact
- Memory: 29MB/100K (target 12MB/1M)
- Without quantization: 15x higher than competitors
- With quantization: Would be ~3x higher (acceptable)

## Conclusion

The storage engine has fundamental issues:
1. **Incomplete implementations** (recovery is TODO)
2. **Silent data modification** (normalization)
3. **Disabled optimizations** (quantization)

These must be fixed before the system can be considered production-ready. The good news is that the architecture is sound - these are implementation issues, not design flaws.
