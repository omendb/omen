## Technical Milestones

### MVP (Oct 7)
```rust
// Minimum functionality required
trait MVPIndex {
    fn train(data: &[(Key, Value)]) -> Self;
    fn lookup(&self, key: Key) -> Option<Value>;
    fn range(&self, start: Key, end: Key) -> Vec<Value>;
}
```

### Alpha (Oct 31)
```rust
// PostgreSQL integration working
CREATE EXTENSION omendb;
CREATE INDEX idx ON table USING learned(column);
SELECT * FROM table WHERE column = ?; -- 10x faster
```

### Beta (Nov 30)
```rust
// Production-ready features
trait BetaIndex: MVPIndex {
    fn insert(&mut self, key: Key, value: Value);
    fn delete(&mut self, key: Key);
    fn update(&mut self, key: Key, value: Value);
}
```

## Benchmarking Targets

### Week 1 Goals
| Metric | B-Tree | Target | Stretch |
|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| Point Lookup | 200ns | 40ns | 20ns |
| Memory | 10MB | 2MB | 1MB |
| Build Time | 1s | 1s | 0.5s |

### Week 2 Goals
| Metric | PostgreSQL | Target | Stretch |
|--------|------------|--------|---------|
| TPC-H Q6 | 500ms | 100ms | 50ms |
| Index Size | 100MB | 20MB | 10MB |
| QPS | 10K | 50K | 100K |

### Month 1 Goals
| Metric | Industry | Target | Stretch |
|--------|----------|--------|---------|
| Correctness | 100% | 100% | 100% |
| P99 Latency | 1ms | 0.1ms | 0.05ms |
| Training | N/A | 100ms | 50ms |

## Resource Allocation

### Time Budget (Weekly)
- **40% Coding**: Core implementation
- **20% Testing**: Correctness & performance
- **20% Research**: Papers & optimization
- **10% Community**: GitHub, Discord, blog
- **10% Business**: YC app, co-founder search

### Mental Energy
- **Morning**: Hardest problems (algorithms)
- **Afternoon**: Integration & testing
- **Evening**: Learning & community

## Risk Mitigation Schedule

### Technical Risks

#### Week 1: Algorithm Risk
**Risk**: RMI doesn't achieve target performance
**Mitigation**:
- Day 3: If <3x improvement, try RadixSpline
- Day 5: If <5x improvement, optimize cache usage
- Day 7: If still failing, pivot to hybrid approach

#### Week 2: Integration Risk
**Risk**: PostgreSQL integration too complex
**Mitigation**:
- Day 10: If no progress, hire PostgreSQL expert
- Day 12: If still blocked, build standalone first
- Day 14: Make go/no-go decision

### Business Risks

#### Week 3: Traction Risk
**Risk**: No community interest
**Mitigation**:
- If <50 GitHub stars, improve messaging
- If <10 users interested, survey for feedback
- If no co-founder leads, expand search

#### Week 4: Funding Risk
**Risk**: YC application weak
**Mitigation**:
- Get feedback from YC alums
- Prepare angel round backup
- Consider other accelerators
