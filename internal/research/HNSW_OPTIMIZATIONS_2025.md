# HNSW+ State-of-the-Art Optimizations (2025 Research)

## Critical Insight: Batch Processing May Be Wrong for HNSW+

**Key Finding**: HNSW+ requires maintaining graph quality during insertion. Deferring graph connections (batch processing) can hurt search recall and precision. The algorithm is designed for incremental updates that maintain connectivity invariants.

## 1. Hub Highway Architecture (ICML 2025)

**Paper**: "Flat Graphs Beat Hierarchical: Rethinking HNSW Architecture"
**Key Innovation**: Flat graph with well-connected hub nodes performs identically to hierarchical HNSW with 30% less memory.

### Implementation Details:
- Identify "hub" nodes with high connectivity (>1.5x average)
- Route searches through hubs first for faster convergence
- No hierarchical layers needed - flat graph is sufficient
- Memory savings: 30% reduction from eliminating layer pointers

### Why It Works:
- Natural emergence of scale-free network topology
- Hub nodes act as shortcuts similar to upper layers
- Reduced indirection improves cache performance

## 2. VSAG Framework (Microsoft Research 2025)

**Paper**: "Vector Search at Scale: A Systems Approach"
**Focus**: Hardware-aware optimizations for modern CPUs

### Key Optimizations:
1. **Smart Distance Switching**:
   - Use low-precision (int8) for initial candidate filtering
   - Switch to full precision only for final ranking
   - 3x speedup with <0.1% recall loss

2. **Cache-Friendly Memory Layout**:
   - Store frequently accessed nodes contiguously
   - Prefetch next likely candidates
   - 40% reduction in cache misses

3. **NUMA-Aware Placement**:
   - Pin hot nodes to local NUMA nodes
   - Reduces memory latency by 25%

## 3. GoVector Innovations (2025)

**Dynamic Spatial Caching**:
- Cache recent search paths
- Reuse paths for similar queries
- 50% speedup for clustered query patterns

## 4. Binary Quantization Breakthrough (NeurIPS 2024)

**Hamming Distance Approximation**:
- Binary quantization with learned thresholds
- 32x memory reduction, 10x speed improvement
- Works especially well with high-dimensional vectors (>128d)

### Implementation:
```mojo
# Each float becomes 1 bit
# 128-dim vector: 512 bytes → 16 bytes
# Distance: dot product → popcount (CPU instruction)
```

## 5. Product Quantization Enhancements (2025)

**Optimized PQ32**:
- 32 subspaces, 256 centroids each
- Lookup tables fit in L2 cache
- SIMD-accelerated distance computation
- 16x compression with 95% recall@10

## Critical Analysis: Why Our Performance Is Low

### Current Bottlenecks (2.8K vec/s) - IDENTIFIED:

1. **Auto-Batching Destroys NumPy Arrays** (ROOT CAUSE):
   - Python API has auto-batching enabled by default
   - Batching collects vectors into Python lists
   - This converts NumPy arrays → Python lists → destroys zero-copy
   - Solution: Disable auto-batching for HNSW+ (it doesn't help anyway)

2. **FFI Overhead Still Present**:
   - Even with NumPy detection, we're copying due to Mojo limitations
   - Need: `UnsafePointer.from_address()` support in Mojo
   - Current workaround: Efficient copying, but still not zero-copy

3. **Graph Update Strategy**:
   - Current: Update after every insertion (CORRECT for HNSW+)
   - Batch deferral would hurt quality - DON'T DO IT
   - Better: Optimize the update itself with SIMD (already done)

### What Actually Improves HNSW+ Performance:

1. **Zero-Copy FFI** (Most Important):
   - Eliminate Python→Mojo conversion
   - Expected: 10-20x speedup
   - Status: Blocked by Mojo pointer casting

2. **SIMD Distance Computation**:
   - Already implemented but needs verification
   - Should provide 4-8x speedup

3. **Binary Quantization for Filtering**:
   - Use binary for candidate selection
   - Full precision for final ranking
   - Currently enabled but not verified

4. **Hub Highway Navigation**:
   - Implemented but hubs not being detected properly
   - Need more aggressive hub identification

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Optimize single vector FFI** - This is the real bottleneck (DONE)
2. **Remove batch graph construction** - It hurts HNSW+ quality
3. **Fix hub detection** - Currently too conservative  
4. **Verify binary quantization** is actually being used in distance computations
5. **Profile with proper tooling** to find real bottlenecks

### Correct Optimizations for HNSW+:
1. **Streaming insertion** with efficient graph updates
2. **Parallel search** across multiple queries
3. **Smart candidate pruning** during insertion
4. **Adaptive ef_construction** based on graph density

### Performance Targets:
- **Insertion**: 50K+ vec/s (with zero-copy FFI)
- **Search**: <1ms for 1M vectors
- **Memory**: 30-50 bytes per vector (with quantization)
- **Recall**: 95%+ at 10

## Key Takeaway

**Batch processing is an anti-pattern for HNSW+**. The algorithm's strength comes from maintaining high-quality graph connections during incremental updates. The real performance gains come from:
1. Eliminating FFI overhead (zero-copy)
2. Hardware-aware optimizations (SIMD, cache-friendly layout)
3. Smart quantization strategies (binary for filtering, full for ranking)
4. Exploiting graph topology (hub highways)

Our current implementation has the right ideas but wrong execution priorities.
