# OmenDB Solo Dev Strategy

**Date**: September 29, 2025
**Reality**: Solo developer, AI-assisted, no funding, not a salesperson

---

## Key Constraints

‚úÖ **What you have:**
- Strong technical skills
- AI assistance (Claude Code = 2-3x faster)
- Proven 10x performance advantage
- Clean Rust codebase

‚ùå **What you don't have:**
- Sales team
- Funding runway
- Time for calls/meetings
- Marketing experience

**Strategy must work around these constraints.**

## Developer-Led Growth (No Sales)

### The Model: Plausible/Fathom/PostHog

**They succeeded as solo/small teams by:**
1. Building excellent product
2. Open sourcing it
3. Launching on HN/Reddit
4. Letting developers discover organically
5. Self-serve pricing (no sales calls)
6. Growing through word-of-mouth

**Revenue:**
- Plausible: $1M+ ARR (2 people)
- Fathom: $150K MRR (solo ‚Üí small team)
- PostHog: $15M ARR (started with 2)

**Common theme**: Zero enterprise sales. All developer-first, self-serve.

  "stripe_token": "..."
}

‚Üí Deploy to Fly.io/Railway/Render
‚Üí Send connection string
‚Üí Customer productive in 2 minutes
```

---

## Revenue Model (No Sales)

### Customer Journey (100% Self-Serve)

```
1. Developer sees HN post
   ‚Üì
2. Reads README, tries docker-compose
   ‚Üì
3. "Wow, this is actually 10x faster"
   ‚Üì
4. Uses in side project (free, self-hosted)
   ‚Üì
5. Project grows, needs production deployment
   ‚Üì
6. Goes to omendb.io
   ‚Üì
7. Clicks "Start Managed" ‚Üí Stripe
   ‚Üì
8. Database deployed in 2 minutes
   ‚Üì
9. You wake up to revenue notification
```

**Zero sales calls. Zero demos. Zero meetings.**

### Pricing Strategy

**Start at $49/month (not free)**
- Filters out tire-kickers
- Serious users happily pay
- $49 feels like impulse buy for devs
- Can always discount for good customers

**Unit Economics:**
```
Customer: $49/month
Cost: ~$10/month (Fly.io hosting)
Margin: $39/month
Churn: 5-10%/month (SaaS average)

10 customers = $500 MRR
50 customers = $2.5K MRR (sustainable!)
100 customers = $5K MRR (quit job territory)
```

**Realistic timeline:**
- Month 3: 10 customers ($500 MRR)
- Month 6: 50 customers ($2.5K MRR)
- Month 12: 100 customers ($5K MRR)

---

## AI-Assisted Development

### What AI Accelerates (2-3x faster):

**Protocol Implementation:**
```
Task: Implement PostgreSQL wire protocol
Manual: 2-3 weeks
With AI: 3-5 days
Speedup: 4x
```

**Boilerplate Code:**
```
- SQL parser integration: 1 day (not 1 week)
- HTTP server setup: 2 hours (not 2 days)
- Stripe integration: 1 day (not 1 week)
- Docker configs: 1 hour (not 1 day)
```

**Documentation:**
```
- AI writes first draft
- You review and edit
- 10x faster than writing from scratch
```

**Tests:**
```
- AI generates test cases
- You review coverage
- 5x faster test writing
```

### What AI Can't Do (Your Job):

- Architecture decisions
- Feature prioritization
- Listening to user feedback
- Marketing/positioning
- Community management

**Bottom line**: You're 2-3x faster overall with AI assistance.

## Funding Options (Ranked)

### 1. Bootstrap via MRR ‚≠ê (Best)

**Pros:**
- No dilution
- You control timeline
- No sales pressure
- Build at your pace

**Cons:**
- Slower growth
- Need to survive 6-12 months
- Some financial stress

**Timeline:**
```
Month 3: $500 MRR (not sustainable yet)
Month 6: $2.5K MRR (can survive in LCOL)
Month 12: $5K MRR (comfortable)
Month 18: $10K MRR (hire contractor)
```

**Viable if**: You have 6-12 month runway (savings, side gigs, living at home)

---

### 2. Part-Time Contract Work

**Model:**
- Contract 3 days/week ($500-1K/day)
- Build OmenDB 2 days/week
- Live on contract income

**Pros:**
- Financial safety
- Zero stress about revenue
- Can build patiently

**Cons:**
- Slower progress (2 days/week vs 7 days)
- Context switching
- Takes 2x longer to launch

**Timeline:**
```
Month 1-2: MVP (2 days/week)
Month 3: Launch
Month 4-8: Grow while contracting
Month 9: If MRR > contract income, quit contracts
```

---

### 3. GitHub Sponsors / Patreon

**Add "Sponsor" button:**
- Some developers pay $5-50/month
- Might get $500-2K/month passive

**Pros:**
- Passive income
- No work required
- Community goodwill

**Cons:**
- Not enough to live on
- Unreliable

**Use as**: Supplement, not primary income

---

### 4. Small Grants

**Options:**
- GitHub Accelerator ($20K)
- Open Source grants
- Indie Hackers contests

**Pros:**
- Non-dilutive capital
- Credibility boost

**Cons:**
- Competitive
- Time-consuming applications
- Unreliable

**Worth trying**: Apply once, but don't count on it

---

### ‚ùå 5. VC Funding (Not for you)

**Why not:**
- Requires pitching (not your strength)
- Sales meetings (not your strength)
- Networking events (time sink)
- Pressure to grow fast (stressful)

**Skip this** until you have strong MRR traction

---

## Marketing Strategy (Developer-First)

### What Works for Solo Devs:

**1. Hacker News Launch ‚≠ê**
```
One good HN post = 10K visitors, 1K GitHub stars
Front page for 12 hours = enough to launch
```

**2. Open Source = Marketing**
```
Good repo ‚Üí People star it ‚Üí Ranks in GitHub
Others write about it ‚Üí Free press
```

**3. Technical Content**
```
Write deep-dives:
- "How Learned Indexes Work"
- "Building a Database in Rust"
- "10x Performance Optimization"

Post on Dev.to, personal blog
SEO benefit + credibility
```

**4. Community Presence**
```
Be active in:
- GitHub issues (respond fast)
- Reddit discussions
- Discord servers
- Twitter dev community

Build reputation as helpful maintainer
```

**5. Word of Mouth**
```
Build such a good product that:
- People tell their friends
- Blog about their experience
- Recommend in Slack channels

This is how Fathom grew
```

### What Doesn't Work:

‚ùå Cold outreach emails (you'll hate this)
‚ùå Sales calls (not your strength)
‚ùå Paid ads (expensive, won't convert)
‚ùå Conferences (time/money sink for solo dev)
‚ùå Enterprise sales (requires sales team)

**Stick to developer-first, product-led growth.**

---

## Decision Points

### Month 3: Is Anyone Using It?

**Check:**
- GitHub stars: 500+ ‚úÖ
- Docker pulls: 1000+ ‚úÖ
- Production users: 10+ ‚úÖ
- Revenue: $500+ MRR ‚úÖ

**If YES**: Keep going, add features
**If NO**:
- Is product bad? (Fix it)
- Is messaging bad? (Change positioning)
- Is timing bad? (Maybe too early/late)
- Consider pivot

---

### Month 6: Will People Pay?

**Check:**
- Managed service signups: 20+ ‚úÖ
- Paying customers: 10+ ‚úÖ
- MRR: $1K+ ‚úÖ
- Churn: <10%/month ‚úÖ

**If YES**:
- You've found product-market fit
- Keep growing
- Consider raising funding or hiring

**If NO**:
- People use free but won't pay
- Either: pricing too high or not enough value
- Iterate or get a job while building

---

### Month 12: Is This Sustainable?

**Check:**
- MRR: $5K+ (can quit job) ‚úÖ
- Growth: +20% month-over-month ‚úÖ
- Churn: <5%/month ‚úÖ
- Feels sustainable? ‚úÖ

**If YES**: You've built a business
**If NO**:
- Still struggling after 12 months
- Probably not working
- Time to pivot or get job

**Be honest with yourself.** Most projects don't work. That's okay.

## Week 1 Action Plan

### Day 1-2: PostgreSQL Protocol (AI-assisted)

```rust
// Use AI to generate:
1. Connection handshake
2. Authentication (trust mode for MVP)
3. Simple query protocol
4. Row data format

// Test with:
psql -h localhost -p 5432
```

### Day 3-4: SQL Integration

```rust
// Use sqlparser-rs
// Map to learned index:
SELECT * FROM metrics WHERE timestamp > X AND timestamp < Y
  ‚Üí index.range_query(X, Y)

INSERT INTO metrics VALUES (timestamp, value, metadata)
  ‚Üí index.insert(timestamp, ...)
```

### Day 5-6: Docker + Docs

```bash
# docker-compose.yml
docker-compose up
# ‚Üí Database running
# ‚Üí Sample data loaded
# ‚Üí Benchmark results shown

# README.md
## Quickstart
git clone ...
docker-compose up
psql -h localhost -p 5432
# Try queries, see 10x speedup
```

### Day 7: Prepare Launch

```markdown
# HN post draft
# Reddit posts
# Dev.to article outline
# GitHub README polish
```

---

## Bottom Line

**For solo dev with no sales skills:**

‚úÖ **Do:**
- Build excellent technical product
- Open source immediately
- Launch on HN/Reddit
- Self-serve pricing
- Let product sell itself

‚ùå **Don't:**
- Try to do enterprise sales
- Build in private for months
- Overcomplicate pricing
- Wait for perfection

**Goal**: Ship fast, get feedback, iterate.

**Timeline**: 2 months to launch, 6 months to $2K MRR, 12 months to $5K MRR.

**You can do this solo.** Others have.
