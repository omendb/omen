# LearnedDB Implementation Roadmap

**Start Date**: October 1, 2025
**YC Application**: Winter 2026 Batch (Deadline: October 15, 2025)

## Week 0: Pre-Launch Preparation (Sept 25-30)

### Technical Setup
- [ ] Set up Rust development environment
- [ ] Create new repository: `learneddb-core`
- [ ] Install dependencies: Candle, pgrx, ndarray, rayon
- [ ] Set up PostgreSQL 15 test environment
- [ ] Create benchmark harness with criterion

### Research Deep Dive
- [ ] Study RMI paper implementation details
- [ ] Review RadixSpline as simpler alternative
- [ ] Analyze SOSD benchmark suite
- [ ] Document key algorithmic insights

### Team Formation
- [ ] Post on HN: "Who wants to build the next-gen database?"
- [ ] Reach out to ML engineers in network
- [ ] Draft co-founder agreement template

## Week 1-2: MVP Core (Oct 1-14) - Pre-YC Deadline

### Goal: Working demo for YC application video

### Implementation Priorities
```rust
// Day 1-3: Basic Learned Index
struct SimpleRMI {
    linear_models: Vec<LinearModel>,
    data: Vec<(i64, Vec<u8>)>,
}

// Day 4-6: PostgreSQL Extension
#[pg_extern]
fn learned_index_scan(key: i64) -> Option<Vec<u8>>

// Day 7-10: Benchmarking
TPC-H Q6 with learned index vs B-tree
Target: 5x faster
```

### Deliverables for YC Video
1. **Live Demo** (2 minutes)
   - Create table with 1M rows
   - Build learned index: `CREATE INDEX learned_idx USING learned(id)`
   - Show 10x faster query: 20ns vs 200ns lookup
   - Display real-time metrics dashboard

2. **Performance Graph**
   - X-axis: Data size (1K to 10M)
   - Y-axis: Lookup latency
   - Two lines: B-tree (logarithmic) vs Learned (constant)

3. **Code Walkthrough** (30 seconds)
   - Show 100 lines of core algorithm
   - Emphasize simplicity of approach

## Week 3-4: Production Features (Oct 15-28)

### Update Handling
```rust
struct ProductionRMI {
    immutable_index: RMI,
    delta_buffer: BTreeMap<Key, Value>,
    background_retrainer: JoinHandle<()>,
}
```

### PostgreSQL Integration
- [ ] Full SQL support via pgrx
- [ ] EXPLAIN ANALYZE integration
- [ ] pg_stat_learned_indexes view
- [ ] Crash recovery via WAL

### Testing
- [ ] Correctness: 10,000 random operations
- [ ] Performance: TPC-H full suite
- [ ] Stress: 100M records, 1000 QPS
- [ ] Crash: Kill -9 recovery testing

## Month 2: Algorithms & Optimization (Nov 1-30)

### Advanced Learned Structures

#### Week 5-6: Learned Joins
```sql
-- 100x faster on sorted data
SELECT * FROM orders o
LEARNED JOIN lineitem l ON o.orderkey = l.orderkey
WHERE o.orderdate > '2023-01-01'
```

#### Week 7-8: Learned Sorting
```rust
// Learned partition points for parallel sort
fn learned_sort(data: &mut [T]) {
    let boundaries = model.predict_quantiles(data);
    parallel_partition_sort(data, boundaries);
}
```

### Performance Optimizations
- [ ] SIMD model inference
- [ ] Huge pages for data storage
- [ ] NUMA-aware memory allocation
- [ ] io_uring for async I/O

### Open Source Release

- [ ] First blog post: "We Made Databases 10x Faster"

## Month 3: Customer Validation (Dec 1-31)

### Target Early Adopters

#### Analytics Startups
- [ ] Reach out to YC companies with data problems
- [ ] Offer free migration assistance
- [ ] Case study: "How X reduced query time 90%"

#### PostgreSQL Users

- [ ] Conference talk proposal for PGConf
- [ ] Integration with popular ORMs

### Production Readiness
- [ ] Automated backup/restore
- [ ] Monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana)
- [ ] Docker Hub images
- [ ] Kubernetes operator

### Metrics for Series A
- [ ] 10 production deployments
- [ ] 1B+ queries served

## Risk Mitigation Timeline

### Week 1: Technical Risk
**Risk**: RMI doesn't perform as expected
**Mitigation**: Start with RadixSpline (simpler, proven)
**Deadline**: Oct 7 - Pivot if needed

### Week 2: Demo Risk
**Risk**: Demo fails during YC recording
**Mitigation**: Pre-record backup, multiple takes
**Deadline**: Oct 13 - Submit application

### Month 2: Adoption Risk
**Risk**: No one wants to try it
**Mitigation**: Build trust via PostgreSQL extension
**Deadline**: Nov 30 - Need 1 user

### Month 3: Funding Risk
**Risk**: YC rejection
**Mitigation**: Apply to multiple accelerators, angel round
**Deadline**: Dec 15 - Backup funding plan

## Resource Requirements

### Technical
- **Development**: MacBook Pro M2 (have)
- **Testing**: AWS EC2 credits ($1000/month)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions (free tier)
- **Monitoring**: Grafana Cloud (free tier)

### Human
- **You**: Systems/Rust development
- **Co-founder**: ML/model optimization
- **Advisor**: Database expert (PostgreSQL committer ideal)

### Financial
- **Months 1-3**: $15K (living expenses)
- **Post-YC**: $500K (seed round)
- **Total needed**: Bootstrap until YC/seed

## Go/No-Go Decision Points

### October 7 (Week 1)
- **Go if**: Basic RMI shows 3x+ improvement
- **No-go if**: Can't beat B-tree performance
- **Pivot**: Try RadixSpline or ALEX

### October 14 (Week 2)
- **Go if**: PostgreSQL extension works
- **No-go if**: Integration impossible
- **Pivot**: Standalone database

### November 30 (Month 2)
- **Go if**: One user in production
- **No-go if**: Zero interest after outreach
- **Pivot**: Focus on specific vertical

### December 31 (Month 3)
- **Go if**: YC interview or angel interest
- **No-go if**: No funding pathway
- **Pivot**: Consulting or join existing startup
