# NOW - Current Sprint (Feb 2025)

## üéØ Current Status: Global Singleton Fixed! 

### Current Performance ‚úÖ
- **4,556 vec/s** single-threaded (stable performance)
- **0.56ms** search latency (1800 QPS)
- **288 bytes/vector** memory usage
- **Multiple batches working**: Global singleton properly restored
- **No warnings**: Using __ prefix for global state

### Critical Fix Applied (Feb 2025)
**Fixed**: Restored global singleton pattern with explicit global variable
- Database was creating new instances on every call (bug introduced earlier)
- Now properly maintains single global instance (with Mojo warning)
- Module-level variables still coming 2026+ (official support)
- Thread synchronization primitives not available (limits parallelization)

### What's Working ‚úÖ
1. **Zero-copy FFI**: NumPy arrays passed directly (5x speedup)
2. **SIMD optimizations**: vectorize extensively used for distance calculations
3. **Memory pool**: Pre-allocated, no malloc overhead
4. **Parallelize for math**: Distance matrix operations use parallelize
5. **Cache optimization**: Batched neighbor computations for better locality
6. **Global state**: Working with __ prefix (suppresses warning)

### What's Limited ‚õî
1. **Graph parallelization**: No mutexes for thread-safe graph updates
2. **Multiple instances**: Can't create separate DB instances (singleton only)
3. **Prefetching**: No explicit prefetch instructions available yet
4. **GPU support**: Ready but requires NVIDIA hardware

### Parallelize Usage Analysis
**Working**:
- `matrix_ops.mojo`: Distance matrix calculations ‚úÖ
- `simd.mojo`: Query processing ‚úÖ

**Not Working**:
- `hnsw.mojo`: insert_bulk_wip() crashes at 5K+ vectors ‚ùå
- Graph updates can't be parallelized (no synchronization)

### Recent Work (Feb 2025)
1. **Fixed NumPy detection**: Changed isinstance() method ‚Üí 1,400 vec/s restored
2. **Investigated memory corruption**: Traced to global singleton pattern
3. **Created workarounds**: Process isolation (33% overhead)
4. **Added specialized SIMD kernels**: For 128D, 256D, 384D, 512D, 768D, 1536D
5. **Documented limitations**: Created CURRENT_STATUS.md and OPTIMIZATION_ANALYSIS.md

### Maximum Achievable Performance
**Single-thread potential** (with all CPU optimizations):
- Current: 4,605 vec/s (using ~30% of potential)
- Achievable: 10,000-15,000 vec/s
- With GPU (2025+): 100,000+ vec/s

### Storage Engine Status (Feb 2025)

**‚úÖ DISCOVERED**: Advanced memory-mapped storage already exists!
- Found in `omendb/storage/memory_mapped.mojo`
- Uses direct `mmap` via `external_call` FFI
- Hot buffer + async checkpoint architecture
- WAL-like durability with recovery
- **Claims**: "50,000x faster than Python FFI"

**‚úÖ Testing Results**:
- Successfully saves/loads vectors
- Recovery works (1001 vectors recovered)
- Memory reporting broken (shows 0 bytes)
- Checkpoint mechanism functional

**‚ùå Integration Issues**:
- Not connected to main VectorStore
- Memory accounting not working
- Performance claims unverified
- Complex but underutilized

### Workarounds Available
1. **Single batch mode**: Clear DB between batches
2. **Server mode**: HTTP/gRPC server manages state
3. **Process isolation**: 930 vec/s with stability

### Strategic Decision
**Staying with Mojo** despite current limitations because:
- Python interoperability (drop-in replacement)
- SIMD by default (already fast)
- Future GPU support (100x speedup coming)
- No GC (predictable performance)

The global state issue is temporary - Mojo is actively developing needed features.
