## üìä Performance Results

### Baseline Comparison
```yaml
Previous Baseline: 867 vec/s
Profiling Results: 2,387.5 vec/s
Improvement Factor: 2.75x
Status: EXCEEDED Week 1 minimum target of 2,000+ vec/s
```

### Individual vs Batch Performance
```yaml

  - Average: 23.3ms per vector (42.9 vec/s)
  - First vector: 116.2ms (initialization overhead)
  - Subsequent: ~0.06ms each

Batch Insertions (1,195 vectors):
  - Rate: 2,387.5 vec/s
  - Time: 0.501 seconds
  - Strategy: Bulk HNSW construction triggered
```

## üîç Detailed Component Breakdown

### Profiling Method
- **Function**: `_insert_node_with_profiling()` in hnsw.mojo
- **Measurements**: High-precision timing with `perf_counter()`
- **Scope**: Component-level breakdown of insertion pipeline

### Bottleneck Analysis (Node 1 - Representative)
```yaml
Total Insertion Time: 0.072ms per vector

Component Breakdown:
  Neighbor Search:         73% (0.053ms) ‚Üê PRIMARY BOTTLENECK
  Connection Management:   24% (0.018ms)
  Pruning Operations:      24% (0.018ms)
  Hierarchical Navigation:  0% (0.000ms)
  Binary Quantization:     <1% (0.001ms)
  Visited Management:       0% (0.000ms)
  Entry Setup:             0% (0.000ms)
```

### Performance Pattern
```yaml
Node 1 (Graph Construction):
  - Neighbor Search: 73% (building initial connections)
  - High connection/pruning overhead

Node 2+ (Incremental Addition):
  - Neighbor Search: 24% (reduced complexity)
  - Navigation: 25% (traversal becomes factor)
  - Minimal connection overhead
```

## üéØ Bottleneck Identification

### 1. Primary Bottleneck: Neighbor Search (73%)
```mojo
// Location: _search_layer_for_M_neighbors() function
// Issue: O(ef_construction) complexity per layer
// Impact: 73% of total insertion time
```

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- `ef_construction = 200` (exploration factor)
- Each layer searches ~200 candidates to find M=16 best neighbors
- Distance calculations dominate (likely SIMD broken)
- Cache misses in graph traversal

### 2. Secondary Bottleneck: Connection Management (24%)
```mojo
// Location: Bidirectional connection setup + pruning
// Issue: Multiple distance calculations for pruning
// Impact: 24% of total insertion time
```

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Bidirectional connection establishment (A‚ÜîB)
- Pruning when connection capacity exceeded
- Additional distance calculations during pruning

### 3. Minimal Impact Components
```yaml
Navigation: 0% - Hierarchical navigation working efficiently
Binary Quantization: <1% - Not the bottleneck
Memory Management: 0% - Pre-allocation working
FFI Overhead: Minimal - Bulk operations reduce impact
```

## üî¨ Technical Findings

### Expected vs Actual Bottlenecks
```yaml
Week 1 Action Plan Prediction:
  - Distance calculations: ~40% ‚úÖ (contained in neighbor search)
  - Graph traversal: ~30% ‚úÖ (contained in neighbor search)
  - Memory allocation: ~15% ‚ùå (0% - pre-allocation working)
  - Connection management: ~10% ‚ùå (24% - higher than expected)
  - FFI overhead: ~5% ‚úÖ (minimal)

Actual Results:
  - Neighbor Search (includes distance + traversal): 73%
  - Connection + Pruning: 24%
  - Everything else: <3%
```

### Performance Scaling
```yaml
Batch Size Impact:
  - Small batches (<1000): Adaptive strategy (857 vec/s)
  - Large batches (‚â•1000): Bulk HNSW construction (2,387 vec/s)
  - Improvement: 2.78x speedup with bulk processing
```
