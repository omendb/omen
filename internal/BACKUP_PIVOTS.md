# Backup Pivot Ideas

**Created**: September 25, 2025
**Current Focus**: Learned Database Systems
**If current pivot fails by Oct 7**: Consider these alternatives

## 1. Multimodal Database (Strongest Alternative)

**Concept**: Database that natively handles text, images, audio, video, code
- **Zero competition**: No existing multimodal databases
- **Market timing**: Perfect (multi-modal AI explosion)
- **Technical moat**: Vector + relational + blob unified storage
- **Go-to-market**: PostgreSQL extension for multimodal data

**Example**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE text_description SIMILAR TO 'red shoes'
  AND product_image SIMILAR TO query_image
  AND price < 100;
```

## 2. Inference Database

**Concept**: Database where every query can invoke ML models
- **Built-in GPU acceleration**
- **Model versioning and A/B testing**
- **Caching of inference results**
- **SQL extensions for ML operations**

**Example**:
```sql
SELECT *, classify_sentiment(review) as sentiment
FROM reviews
WHERE embed_similarity(content, 'customer service issues') > 0.8;
```

## 3. Max-Optimized Vector Database

**Concept**: Use Max inference engine advantages for ultra-fast vector search
- **10-100x faster than competitors using Max**
- **First to leverage Max's unique capabilities**
- **Target enterprise customers needing extreme performance**

## 4. Edge Database System

**Concept**: Database designed for edge computing
- **Ultra-lightweight (< 1MB)**
- **Works offline with sync**
- **Perfect for IoT/mobile**
- **Rust-based, cross-platform**

## 5. Time Series + Vector Hybrid

**Concept**: Database optimized for time-series data with vector embeddings
- **IoT sensor data + semantic search**
- **Financial data + ML predictions**
- **Logs + anomaly detection**

## Decision Framework

**If learned database fails, evaluate in this order:**

1. **Multimodal Database** (if we need a big swing)
2. **Inference Database** (if we want ML focus)
3. **Max Vector Database** (if we want performance focus)
4. **Edge Database** (if we want different market)

**Evaluation criteria**:
- Can we build a meaningful demo in 1 week?
- Is there zero/minimal competition?
- Does it leverage our unique skills?
- Is the market timing right?

## Research Preserved

Key research papers and competitive analyses are in:
- `external/papers/` - Core research
- `internal/BUSINESS.md` - Market analysis
- Git history - All previous strategic thinking

## Quick Access Commands

```bash
# If we need to pivot:
git log --oneline | grep -i "vector\|multimodal\|pivot"  # Find old work
find . -name "*.md" | xargs grep -l "multimodal\|inference"  # Find relevant docs
```

**Remember**: The learned database pivot is strong (7.89x achieved on Day 1). Only use these backups if we can't reach 10x by Oct 7.
