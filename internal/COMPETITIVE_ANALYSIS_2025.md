## Technical Implementation Patterns

### How They Achieve High Performance

#### 1. **Segment Parallelism** (Qdrant, Milvus)
```
Split index into independent segments
Build segments in parallel
Merge results at query time
Result: Near-linear scaling with cores
```

#### 2. **Lock-Free Data Structures** (Qdrant, Pinecone)
```
Atomic operations for updates
Wait-free readers
Lock-free priority queues
Result: No thread contention
```

#### 3. **SIMD Everywhere** (All except Chroma)
```
Vectorized distance calculations
Batch operations on 8-16 floats
Platform-specific optimizations (AVX-512)
Result: 4-8x speedup on distances
```

#### 4. **Memory Layout Optimization** (Qdrant, LanceDB)
```
Cache-aligned structures
Hot/cold data separation
Prefetching strategies
Result: 2-3x reduction in cache misses
```

#### 5. **Zero-Copy Operations** (LanceDB, Milvus)
```
mmap for direct disk access
Arrow format for columnar data
Shared memory between processes
Result: Eliminate serialization overhead
```

#### 6. **GPU Acceleration** (Milvus, some Qdrant)
```
CUDA kernels for distance calc
GPU graph traversal
Tensor operations
Result: 10-100x speedup (with cost)
```
