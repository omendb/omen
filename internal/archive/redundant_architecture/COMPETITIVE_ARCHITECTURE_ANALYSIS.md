# 🎯 Competitive Architecture Analysis & Refactor Strategy

**Date**: September 20, 2025
**Goal**: Match or exceed 15K+ vec/s with 95% recall

## 📊 How Competitors Achieve High Performance

### 1. Qdrant (15-25K vec/s, 95% recall)
```
Architecture:
├── Rust + SIMD acceleration
├── Segments with smart routing (not random)
├── Async I/O with io_uring
├── Write-ahead logging
└── Quantization (scalar/binary)

Key Insight: Segments are NOT randomly distributed
- Uses payload-based routing
- Multitenancy isolation
- Query planning optimization
```

### 2. Weaviate (10-20K vec/s, 95% recall)
```
Architecture:
├── Dynamic Index (THE KEY PATTERN)
│   ├── Flat buffer: 0-10K vectors
│   └── HNSW: 10K+ vectors (built async)
├── Async indexing with persistent queue
├── Background index building
└── Written in Go

Key Insight: NEVER blocks insertion for indexing
- Insert → Flat buffer (instant)
- Background → Build HNSW
- Query → Use whichever is ready
```

### 3. Milvus/Zilliz (20-30K vec/s, 95% recall)
```
Architecture:
├── Growing segments (flat, in-memory)
├── Sealed segments (indexed, on-disk)
├── Background compaction
├── Interim indexes for growing segments
└── Clustering compaction

Key Insight: Time-based segmentation
- New data → Growing segment (flat)
- Old data → Sealed segment (HNSW)
- Background → Merge & optimize
```

### 4. Elasticsearch/Lucene (with BBQ)
```
Optimizations:
├── SIMD (AVX/NEON) for distance calc
├── Binary quantization (32x compression)
├── Asymmetric quantization
└── Java Panama Vector API

Key Insight: Extreme optimization of distance calculation
- 40x speedup with binary quantization
- Hardware-specific optimizations
```

## 🔍 The Universal Pattern

**ALL high-performance engines use the same strategy:**

```
INSERT PATH (Fast):
User → Flat Buffer → Return (45K+ vec/s)
         ↓
    [Background]
         ↓
    Build Index

QUERY PATH (Adaptive):
User → Router → [Flat Buffer] (if <threshold)
              → [HNSW Index] (if ready)
              → [Both + Merge] (during transition)
```

**This is NOT "Option 1" (smart routing between segments)**
**This IS "Option 3" (hybrid flat + background HNSW)**

## 🚀 Proposed OmenDB Architecture Refactor

### Phase 1: Hybrid Flat+HNSW (Like Weaviate)

```mojo
struct HybridIndex:
    var flat_buffer: FlatIndex           # Always accepts inserts
    var hnsw_index: Optional[HNSWIndex]  # Built in background
    var indexing_queue: PersistentQueue  # Vectors to index
    var is_indexing: Atomic[Bool]        # Background thread status
    var threshold: Int = 10000           # When to start HNSW

    fn insert(vector) -> Int:
        # ALWAYS insert to flat buffer (instant)
        id = flat_buffer.append(vector)  # 45K vec/s

        # Queue for background indexing if needed
        if flat_buffer.size >= threshold and not is_indexing:
            start_background_indexing()

        return id  # Return immediately

    fn search(query, k) -> Results:
        # Use best available index
        if hnsw_index and hnsw_index.is_ready:
            if flat_buffer.has_unindexed_vectors():
                # Merge results from both
                hnsw_results = hnsw_index.search(query, k)
                flat_results = flat_buffer.search_unindexed(query, k)
                return merge_results(hnsw_results, flat_results)
            else:
                return hnsw_index.search(query, k)
        else:
            return flat_buffer.search(query, k)

    fn background_indexing_thread():
        while indexing_queue.has_items():
            batch = indexing_queue.get_batch(1000)
            hnsw_index.add_batch(batch)
        mark_indexed_vectors()
```

### Phase 2: Growing/Sealed Segments (Like Milvus)

```mojo
struct SegmentManager:
    var growing_segment: FlatIndex      # Current insertions
    var sealed_segments: List[HNSWIndex] # Historical data
    var sealing_threshold: Int = 50000   # When to seal

    fn insert(vector) -> Int:
        id = growing_segment.append(vector)

        if growing_segment.size >= sealing_threshold:
            seal_current_segment()

        return id

    fn seal_current_segment():
        # Move to background job
        old_segment = growing_segment
        growing_segment = FlatIndex()  # New empty segment

        # Background: Build HNSW for old segment
        schedule_background_job(build_hnsw, old_segment)
```

### Phase 3: Extreme Optimizations

1. **SIMD Distance Calculations**
```mojo
@always_inline
fn simd_l2_distance(a: UnsafePointer[Float32], b: UnsafePointer[Float32], dim: Int) -> Float32:
    # Use Mojo's SIMD types for vectorization
    var sum = SIMD[DType.float32, 8](0)

    @parameter
    for i in range(0, dim, 8):
        var va = a.load[width=8](i)
        var vb = b.load[width=8](i)
        var diff = va - vb
        sum += diff * diff

    return sum.reduce_add()
```

2. **Binary Quantization**
```mojo
struct BinaryQuantizedVector:
    var bits: UnsafePointer[UInt64]  # 1 bit per dimension

    fn hamming_distance(self, other: BinaryQuantizedVector) -> Int:
        # Use POPCNT instruction for fast bit counting
        return popcount(self.bits ^ other.bits)
```

3. **Lock-Free Data Structures**
```mojo
struct LockFreeQueue:
    # Use atomic operations for thread-safe queue
    var head: Atomic[Int]
    var tail: Atomic[Int]
```

## 📈 Expected Performance

### With Hybrid Architecture:
- **Insertion**: 40K+ vec/s (flat buffer speed)
- **Build Speed**: 10K vec/s (background, doesn't block)
- **Search**: 2-3ms (HNSW when ready)
- **Recall**: 95%+ (proven HNSW quality)

### Why This Will Work:
1. **Insertion never blocks** - Always goes to flat buffer
2. **Background indexing** - Doesn't affect insert speed
3. **Adaptive search** - Uses best available index
4. **No quality loss** - HNSW built properly in background

## 🛠️ Implementation Plan

### Week 1: Hybrid Flat+HNSW
1. Extend flat buffer to persist beyond threshold
2. Add background thread for HNSW building
3. Implement query router for index selection
4. Add merge logic for hybrid results

### Week 2: Background Indexing
1. Implement persistent queue (disk-backed)
2. Add indexing thread with batching
3. Track indexed vs unindexed vectors
4. Test with 100K+ vectors

### Week 3: Optimizations
1. SIMD distance calculations
2. Binary quantization option
3. Memory-mapped flat buffer
4. Parallel segment processing

### Week 4: Production Features
1. Persistence and recovery
2. Monitoring and metrics
3. Configuration tuning
4. Benchmark validation

## ✅ Summary

**The best way to refactor is the Hybrid Flat+HNSW approach (like Weaviate):**

1. **It's proven**: Weaviate gets 10-20K vec/s with this
2. **It's simpler**: No complex routing or segmentation
3. **It's fast**: Insertion always at flat buffer speed
4. **It's correct**: HNSW quality preserved

This is **NOT Option 1** (smart segmentation) - that's what Qdrant does with payload routing.
This is **Option 3** from my earlier analysis - the hybrid approach.

**All competitors use variations of this pattern because it works.**
