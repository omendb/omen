# üî¨ OmenDB Performance Analysis

**Date**: September 20, 2025
**Focus**: Understanding the 10K threshold performance drop

## üìä Performance Breakdown

### Flat Buffer Mode (‚â§10K vectors)
- **Speed**: 45K vec/s
- **Recall**: 100%
- **Operation**: Simple append to memory buffer
- **Complexity**: O(1) insertion

### HNSW Mode (>10K vectors)
- **Speed**: 5-6K vec/s (88% slower than flat buffer)
- **Recall**: 90-98%
- **Operation**: Complex graph construction
- **Complexity**: O(log n) insertion with neighbor selection

### Migration Process (at 10K)
- **Time**: 1.39 seconds for 10K vectors
- **Speed**: 7.2K vec/s
- **Method**: Individual insertion (bulk doesn't help - still calls individual internally)
- **Quality**: 98% recall maintained

## üéØ Root Cause Analysis

**The performance drop is NOT due to migration overhead**

The 5-6K vec/s is the inherent speed of HNSW insertion, which involves:
1. Finding M nearest neighbors (expensive distance calculations)
2. Selecting optimal connections (pruning algorithm)
3. Updating bidirectional edges
4. Maintaining layer hierarchy

**Why competitors are faster:**
- **Qdrant**: 15-25K vec/s - Uses segmented parallel insertion + optimized C++
- **Weaviate**: 10-20K vec/s - Uses bulk construction + parallel segments
- **ChromaDB**: 3-5K vec/s - Similar to our performance (Python/SQLite based)

## üí° Potential Solutions

### Option 1: Accept Current Performance (SIMPLEST)
- **Pros**: Working, stable, good recall
- **Cons**: Not competitive with Qdrant/Weaviate
- **Verdict**: Matches ChromaDB, acceptable for MVP

### Option 2: True Parallel HNSW (BEST PERFORMANCE)
- **Implementation**: Use `parallelize` for independent graph regions
- **Expected**: 3-4x speedup (15-20K vec/s)
- **Challenge**: Complex synchronization, potential quality issues
- **Status**: Code exists but needs debugging

### Option 3: Hybrid Flat+HNSW (INNOVATIVE)
- **Concept**: Keep inserting into flat buffer, build HNSW in background
- **Insertion**: Always 45K vec/s (flat buffer speed)
- **Search**: Use HNSW if ready, flat buffer if not
- **Challenge**: Complex state management

### Option 4: Bulk Batching (QUICK WIN)
- **Concept**: Collect insertions, process in batches of 100-1000
- **Expected**: 1.5-2x speedup (10-12K vec/s)
- **Implementation**: Buffer API calls, flush periodically
- **Challenge**: API changes needed

### Option 5: Lower Quality for Speed
- **Change**: Reduce ef_construction from 75 to 25
- **Result**: 2x faster insertion, 85% recall
- **Trade-off**: Sacrifice quality for speed
- **Not recommended**: Quality should be priority

## üèÅ Recommendations

### Immediate (Today)
1. **Keep current settings** - 5-6K vec/s with 90%+ recall is usable
2. **Document performance** - Set clear expectations
3. **Fix bulk insertion** - Minor optimizations possible

### Short Term (Week)
1. **Implement batch API** - Buffer insertions for bulk processing
2. **Test parallel segments** - Debug existing parallel code
3. **Profile bottlenecks** - Find specific slow operations

### Long Term (Month)
1. **Rewrite in C++** - If Mojo can't match Rust/C++ performance
2. **GPU acceleration** - Use CUDA for distance calculations
3. **Alternative algorithms** - Consider DiskANN, ScaNN, or FAISS

## üìà Current Competitive Position

```
ChromaDB:    3-5K vec/s   ‚Üê We are here (5-6K)
OmenDB:      5-6K vec/s   ‚Üê Current performance
Weaviate:   10-20K vec/s  ‚Üê Target (2-3x improvement needed)
Qdrant:     15-25K vec/s  ‚Üê Stretch goal (3-4x improvement)
Pinecone:   30-50K vec/s  ‚Üê Industry leader (cloud-based)
```

We're **slightly better than ChromaDB** but **2-3x slower than industry leaders**.

## ‚úÖ Summary

The performance drop at 10K vectors is **expected and normal** for the algorithm switch from flat buffer to HNSW. The migration itself is reasonably fast.

**Key insight**: HNSW is inherently slower than flat buffer due to complex graph operations. This is a fundamental trade-off between speed and scalability.

**Path forward**:
1. Accept current performance for MVP (matches ChromaDB)
2. Implement parallel insertion for competitive performance
3. Consider hybrid approaches for best user experience
