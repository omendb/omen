# üöÄ Segmented HNSW Performance Results

**Date**: September 20, 2025
**Test**: Enabled SegmentedHNSW with 8 parallel segments

## üìä Performance Comparison

### Speed (vec/s) - ‚úÖ MASSIVE IMPROVEMENT
| Vectors | Monolithic HNSW | Segmented HNSW | Speedup |
|---------|----------------|----------------|---------|
| 20,000  | 7,200 vec/s    | 14,000 vec/s   | 1.9x    |
| 30,000  | 6,900 vec/s    | 11,800 vec/s   | 1.7x    |
| 50,000  | 6,600 vec/s    | 10,400 vec/s   | 1.6x    |

**Achievement**: We nearly doubled insertion speed! üéâ

### Recall@10 - ‚ùå CATASTROPHIC DEGRADATION
| Vectors | Monolithic HNSW | Segmented HNSW | Loss    |
|---------|----------------|----------------|---------|
| 20,000  | 88%            | 54%            | -34%    |
| 30,000  | 80%            | 33%            | -47%    |
| 50,000  | 81%            | 17%            | -64%    |

**Problem**: Recall is unusable at production scale

### Search Latency - ‚ùå SEVERE DEGRADATION
| Vectors | Monolithic HNSW | Segmented HNSW | Slowdown |
|---------|----------------|----------------|----------|
| All     | 2-3ms          | 83-84ms        | 28-40x   |

**Problem**: Search is too slow for real-time applications

## üî¨ Root Cause Analysis

### Why Speed Improved
1. **True parallelism**: 8 segments process independently
2. **Smaller graphs**: Each segment only handles 1/8th of data
3. **Cache efficiency**: Smaller working sets per segment
4. **No contention**: Segments don't interfere with each other

### Why Quality Degraded
1. **Data isolation**: Each segment only knows about its own vectors
2. **No cross-segment navigation**: HNSW can't traverse between segments
3. **Random distribution**: Round-robin doesn't preserve data locality
4. **Independent search**: Must query all 8 segments separately

### Why Search Is Slow
1. **8x queries**: Must search all 8 segments
2. **Serial execution**: Segments searched one by one
3. **Result merging**: Must combine and sort 8 result sets
4. **Quality filtering**: Additional overhead to filter bad results

## üí° Potential Solutions

### Option 1: Fewer Segments (QUICK FIX)
- Use 2-4 segments instead of 8
- Better balance between speed and quality
- Expected: 10K vec/s, 70% recall, 20ms search

### Option 2: Smart Routing (COMPLEX)
- Use LSH or clustering to route similar vectors to same segment
- Maintains locality for better recall
- Challenge: Routing overhead might negate speed gains

### Option 3: Cross-Segment Links (HARD)
- Allow HNSW edges between segments
- Maintains graph connectivity
- Challenge: Synchronization complexity

### Option 4: Hybrid Approach (RECOMMENDED)
- Use monolithic HNSW for <50K vectors (good quality)
- Use segmented only for 100K+ vectors (where quality matters less)
- Let users choose: `fast_mode=True` for speed, `False` for quality

### Option 5: Revert to Monolithic (SAFEST)
- Accept 6-7K vec/s performance
- Maintain 85%+ recall
- Keep 2-3ms search latency
- Focus on other optimizations

## üéØ Recommendation

**SHORT TERM**: Revert to monolithic HNSW
- Quality is more important than speed
- 6-7K vec/s matches ChromaDB
- 85%+ recall is production ready

**LONG TERM**: Implement proper distributed HNSW
- Study Qdrant's approach (they solved this)
- Use segment routing based on data similarity
- Implement cross-segment rebalancing
- Target: 15K vec/s with 95% recall

## üìà Competitive Analysis

### Current State
```
OmenDB Monolithic: 6-7K vec/s, 85% recall, 3ms search
OmenDB Segmented: 10-14K vec/s, 17-54% recall, 84ms search
ChromaDB:         3-5K vec/s, 95% recall, 5ms search
Qdrant:          15-25K vec/s, 95% recall, 2ms search
```

### Conclusion
Our segmented approach achieves Qdrant-like insertion speed but with unusable recall and search latency. The monolithic approach has ChromaDB-like speed with acceptable quality.

**Verdict**: Keep monolithic HNSW for now, research better segmentation strategies.

## üîß Code Changes Made

1. Added `insert()` method to SegmentedHNSW for individual vectors
2. Modified native.mojo to use SegmentedHNSW after migration
3. Changed migration to use SegmentedHNSW batch insertion

**To revert**: Set `use_segmented = False` in native.mojo line 185 and 271.
