# üéØ FLAT_BUFFER_THRESHOLD Update Results

**Date**: September 20, 2025
**Change**: Updated FLAT_BUFFER_THRESHOLD from 500 to 10,000 vectors

## ‚úÖ Key Achievements

### 1. Fixed Critical Test Bug
- **Issue**: Tests were using singleton database without clearing between runs
- **Impact**: Vector counts were cumulative (showed 6000 when inserted 5000)
- **Fix**: Added `db.clear()` between test runs
- **Result**: Accurate measurements now possible

### 2. Matched Industry Standard
- **Research**: Qdrant, Weaviate, ChromaDB all use 10K threshold
- **Rationale**: Flat buffer is 2-4x faster with 100% recall for small datasets
- **Implementation**: Updated threshold from 500 to 10,000 vectors

### 3. Corrected Recall Measurement
- **Issue**: Was sampling 5K vectors for ground truth, causing false low recall
- **Fix**: Use all vectors for accurate recall measurement
- **Impact**: Real recall is 80-88%, not 9-26% as previously measured

## üìä Current Performance Profile

### Small Scale (‚â§10K vectors) - Flat Buffer
| Vectors | Insertion | Recall@10 | Status |
|---------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| 1,000   | 26K vec/s | 100%      | ‚úÖ Perfect |
| 5,000   | 43K vec/s | 100%      | ‚úÖ Perfect |
| 10,000  | 46K vec/s | 100%      | ‚úÖ Perfect |

### Medium Scale (10K-20K vectors) - HNSW Migration
| Vectors | Insertion | Recall@10 | Status |
|---------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| 11,000  | 7.8K vec/s | 100%     | ‚úÖ Excellent |
| 12,000  | 7.8K vec/s | 97%      | ‚úÖ Good |
| 15,000  | 7.6K vec/s | 93-96%   | ‚úÖ Good |

### Large Scale (20K+ vectors) - Pure HNSW
| Vectors | Insertion | Recall@10 | Status |
|---------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| 20,000  | 7.2K vec/s | 88-94%   | ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs improvement |
| 30,000  | 6.9K vec/s | 80%      | ‚ö†Ô∏è Below target |
| 50,000  | 6.6K vec/s | 81%      | ‚ö†Ô∏è Below target |

## üéØ Competitive Position

### Current vs Target
- **Current Speed**: 6.6-7.2K vec/s at scale
- **Target Speed**: 10K+ vec/s (industry competitive)
- **Gap**: Need 40-50% speed improvement

- **Current Recall**: 80-88% at scale
- **Target Recall**: 95%+ (industry standard)
- **Gap**: Need 7-15% quality improvement

### Competitive Benchmarks
- **ChromaDB**: 3-5K vec/s, 95% recall ‚Üí We're faster but lower quality
- **Qdrant**: 15-25K vec/s, 95% recall ‚Üí They're 2-3x faster with better quality
- **Weaviate**: 10-20K vec/s, 95% recall ‚Üí They're 1.5-3x faster with better quality

## üîß Next Steps

### Priority 1: Fix HNSW Quality (80% ‚Üí 95% recall)
- Increase ef_construction from 50 to 100-200
- Fix diverse starting points in search (currently using node ID spacing)
- Consider re-enabling Hub Highway optimization
- Tune M parameter (currently 16, try 24-32)

### Priority 2: Improve Speed (7K ‚Üí 10K+ vec/s)
- Implement proper bulk insertion (currently using individual)
- Enable SIMD distance calculations consistently
- Optimize graph construction pruning
- Consider segment parallelism for insertion

### Priority 3: Scale Testing
- Test up to 100K vectors
- Measure memory usage at scale
- Profile bottlenecks with larger datasets

## üí° Key Insights

1. **Threshold Timing Matters**: 10K is industry standard for good reason - flat buffer maintains perfect quality up to this scale

2. **Migration Works Well**: The transition from flat buffer to HNSW at 10K maintains 97-100% recall initially

3. **Scale Degradation**: Quality degrades from 96% at 15K to 80% at 50K - need to fix graph construction

4. **Speed Acceptable**: 6.6-7.2K vec/s is usable but not competitive - need optimization

5. **Search Fast**: 2-3ms latency is excellent - no issues with query performance

## ‚úÖ Summary

The 10K threshold update is successful and matches industry standards. The system now provides:
- **Perfect recall** for datasets up to 10K vectors (most common use case)
- **Good recall** (93-96%) up to 15K vectors
- **Acceptable recall** (80-88%) at larger scales

Next focus: Improve HNSW to achieve 95%+ recall at all scales while maintaining or improving the current 7K vec/s insertion rate.
