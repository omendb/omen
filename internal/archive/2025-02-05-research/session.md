# Last Session Summary

## Session Context
**Date**: Feb 5, 2025  
**Duration**: Extended research and cleanup session
**AI Agent**: Claude Code (Sonnet 4)

## Major Decisions Made

### 1. Algorithm Pivot: DiskANN → HNSW+
**Why**: DiskANN fundamentally incompatible with streaming updates
- Industry reality: Everyone uses HNSW except Microsoft
- Research showed IP-DiskANN is unproven (Feb 2025 paper only)
- HNSW+ benefits from Mojo's SIMD and parallelism strengths

### 2. Documentation Cleanup
**Before**: 847 MD files scattered across repo
**After**: Structured 15-file system
- Archived redundant analysis files
- Consolidated to actionable docs only

### 3. Business Strategy Confirmation
- Open source (CPU) for adoption
- Premium cloud (GPU) for revenue
- Pure vectors first, multimodal in Phase 2

## Work Completed

### Research ✅
- Analyzed IP-DiskANN vs HNSW+ vs CAGRA
- Reviewed competitor architectures 
- Studied Claude Code documentation best practices
- Confirmed Mojo FFI strategies

### Cleanup ✅
- Reduced 847 → 4 files (too much)
- Now creating 15-file middle ground
- Archived old research and redundant files

### Documentation ✅
- Updated CLAUDE.md with AI management rules
- Created CURRENT_PLAN.md for context continuity
- Established clear decision log in DECISIONS.md

## Current State

### Ready to Implement
- Algorithm chosen (HNSW+)
- Architecture decided (Mojo core)
- Business model clear
- Documentation organized

### Next Steps
1. Create remaining doc structure files
2. Start HNSW+ implementation in `omendb/engine/algorithms/hnsw.mojo`
3. Define basic structures (HNSWIndex, layers, neighbors)

## Key Context for Next Session

### What Changed
- **Major pivot**: DiskANN → HNSW+ (complete algorithm change)
- **Doc strategy**: From chaos → organized (but actionable)
- **Implementation focus**: Start coding, stop analyzing

### Critical Files
- `internal/CURRENT_PLAN.md` - Complete current state
- `internal/DECISIONS.md` - Why we chose what
- `internal/current/sprint.md` - This week's tasks

### Important Note
We need to **review pure vector vs multimodal strategy** now that we've switched to HNSW+. HNSW may be better suited for multimodal than DiskANN was.
