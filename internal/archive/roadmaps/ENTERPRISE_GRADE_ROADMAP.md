# Enterprise-Grade Completion Roadmap

**Date**: October 14, 2025
**Status**: Phase 1 Complete, 8 critical phases remaining
**Timeline**: 10-14 weeks to enterprise-grade
**Current Focus**: Technical excellence, not marketing

---

## Executive Summary

**Current Reality**: We have strong foundations but critical gaps for enterprise deployment.

**Completed Today** (Phase 1):
- ✅ Performance validation: 1.53x-3.54x vs SQLite (honest benchmarks)
- ✅ Crash safety: 100% recovery validated at 1M scale
- ✅ Bottleneck identified: RocksDB (77%), ALEX (21%)
- ✅ Initial optimization: +12% improvement at 10M scale

**Critical Gaps Remaining**:
1. **Transaction rollback doesn't work** (ACID violation)
2. **10M scale performance** (1.93x vs 2x+ target)
3. **UPDATE/DELETE not implemented**
4. **Concurrency not stress tested** (24+ hours)
5. **No data corruption detection** (checksums, fsync validation)
6. **Limited observability** (no explain plans, slow query logging)
7. **No operational tooling** (backup/restore)
8. **Security not hardened** (TLS, RBAC, audit logs)

**Timeline to Enterprise-Grade**: 10-14 weeks of focused technical work
