# OmenDB Progress Summary - August 24, 2025

## ‚úÖ MAJOR WINS TODAY

### 1. Memory Reduction: 26.4x Improvement
- **Problem**: 778MB for 100K vectors
- **Root Cause**: Double storage (vectors in both dict and CSR graph)
- **Fix**: Removed duplicate storage, retrieve from CSR only
- **Result**: 29MB for 100K vectors (26.4x reduction!)

### 2. Segment Merging: Fixed
- **Problem**: Each flush replaced index causing duplicates
- **Root Cause**: `self.main_index = new_segment` replaced instead of merging
- **Fix**: Implemented proper merge logic - add to existing index
- **Result**: Count now correct, no duplicates

### 3. Comprehensive Test Suite Created
- Created test_comprehensive_storage.py
- Tests all major components
- Identified all critical issues systematically

## üî¥ CRITICAL ISSUES REMAINING

### 1. Memory-Mapped Storage: Complete Data Loss
- Checkpoint reports success but saves 0 vectors
- Recovery loads nothing
- **Priority**: HIGH - persistence is broken

### 2. Quantization: Not Working
- enable_quantization() succeeds but no memory savings
- Using 35MB instead of 1.2MB for 10K vectors  
- **Priority**: HIGH - missing 4-32x memory reduction

### 3. Memory Tracking: 1476% Inaccurate
- Reports 10MB when actual is 0.66MB
- ComponentMemoryStats accumulation broken
- **Priority**: MEDIUM - can't trust metrics

### 4. Clear() Memory Leak: 0.18MB
- Small but accumulates over time
- **Priority**: LOW - minor issue

## üìä CURRENT STATUS

### Performance Metrics
- **Memory**: 29MB/100K vectors (target: 12MB/1M vectors)
- **Insert Speed**: 2,056 vec/s at 100K scale  
- **Search**: Working correctly
- **Persistence**: BROKEN

### What Works
- ‚úÖ Basic vector operations (add, search)
- ‚úÖ Segment merging (no more duplicates)
- ‚úÖ CSR graph storage (memory efficient)
- ‚úÖ Vector normalization for cosine similarity

### What Doesn't Work
- ‚ùå Memory-mapped persistence
- ‚ùå Quantization (scalar and binary)
- ‚ùå Memory tracking accuracy
- ‚ùå Clear() full cleanup

## üéØ NEXT PRIORITIES

1. **Fix Memory-Mapped Storage** (Data loss is critical)
   - Debug checkpoint logic
   - Ensure vectors actually written to mmap files
   - Fix recovery loading

2. **Enable Quantization** (4-32x memory savings available)
   - Check why quantization flag not applied
   - Verify quantized vectors used in storage
   - Test memory reduction

3. **Fix Memory Tracking** (Need accurate metrics)
   - Fix ComponentMemoryStats accumulation
   - Track CSR graph memory correctly
   - Remove double counting

## üìà PROGRESS TOWARD GOALS

### Memory Target
- **Goal**: 12-20MB per 1M vectors (like competitors)
- **Current**: 294MB per 1M vectors (extrapolated)
- **Gap**: Still 14.7x higher than best competitors
- **Path**: Quantization should give 4x, bringing us to ~73MB/1M

### Key Achievements
- 26.4x memory reduction from fixing double storage
- Segment merging now works correctly
- Comprehensive test coverage established
- Critical issues identified and prioritized

## üí° LESSONS LEARNED

1. **Double storage is common** - Vectors often stored in multiple places
2. **Normalization changes values** - Important for test design
3. **Segment merging is tricky** - Replace vs merge is critical distinction
4. **Memory tracking is hard** - Easy to double count or miss components
5. **Test everything** - Comprehensive tests revealed many hidden issues

*Great progress today! Memory reduced 26x and segment merging fixed. 
Focus next on persistence and quantization for another 4-32x reduction.*
