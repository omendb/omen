# AlexStorage Development Roadmap

**Date:** October 6, 2025
**Current State:** Phase 4 complete (WAL durability)
**Strategy:** Specialize as high-performance read-optimized storage

---

## Current Status

### Completed (Phases 1-4)

‚úÖ **Phase 1:** Foundation (ALEX + mmap)
- 3.49x faster queries than RocksDB at 100K scale

‚úÖ **Phase 2:** Write optimization (deferred remapping)
- 7.02x faster mixed workload at 100K scale
- 31.73x faster mixed workload at 1M scale

‚úÖ **Phase 3:** Read optimization (zero-copy)
- 4.23x faster queries at 1M scale
- 14% query improvement

‚úÖ **Phase 4:** Durability (WAL)
- Crash recovery implemented
- 4.81x faster queries at 1M scale
- 28.59x faster mixed workload at 1M scale

### Missing (Critical for Production)

üî¥ **P0 (Blocking):**
- Concurrency (single-threaded only)
- Delete operations (can't remove data)

üü° **P1 (Important):**
- Compaction (space reclamation)
- Group commit (3.14x slower bulk inserts)

üü¢ **P2 (Nice to have):**
- Range queries
- Compression
- Checksums
- Monitoring

## Strategic Direction

### Option Analysis

**Option 1: Specialize (CHOSEN)**
- Focus: Read-optimized storage for specific use cases
- Timeline: 2 weeks to production-ready
- Market: "Fastest read cache with durability"
- Features: Concurrency + deletes + basic compaction + group commit

**Option 2: Build to Parity**
- Focus: General-purpose RocksDB replacement
- Timeline: 2-3 months
- Risk: Won't beat RocksDB on writes
- Features: Everything RocksDB has

**Option 3: Hybrid**
- Focus: RocksDB writes + AlexStorage reads
- Timeline: 2-3 weeks
- Complexity: Syncing, consistency
- Features: Best of both worlds

**Decision: Option 1 (Specialize)**

**Rationale:**
1. We have 4.81x read advantage - exploit it
2. Write optimization is diminishing returns
3. Faster time to production (2 weeks vs 2-3 months)
4. Clear market positioning

## Roadmap (Next 2 Weeks)

### Phase 5: Concurrency (P0 - Days 1-3)

**Goal:** Support multi-threaded access

**Approach:** Read-write locks (simple, effective)

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Day 1: Add `RwLock<AlexStorage>` wrapper
- [ ] Day 1: Implement concurrent read API
- [ ] Day 2: Implement concurrent write API (serialized)
- [ ] Day 2: Add tests (concurrent reads, writes)
- [ ] Day 3: Benchmark (multi-threaded workload)
- [ ] Day 3: Document performance characteristics

**Expected Performance:**
- Concurrent reads: Near-linear scaling (4 threads ‚Üí 4x throughput)
- Concurrent writes: No improvement (serialized by lock)
- Mixed (4 threads): 2-3x throughput improvement

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ All tests passing with concurrent access
- ‚úÖ No data corruption
- ‚úÖ 2x+ throughput with 4 reader threads

---

### Phase 6: Delete Operations (P0 - Days 4-5)

**Goal:** Support delete operations

**Approach:** Tombstones (simple, deferred compaction)

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Day 4: Implement `delete(key)` method
- [ ] Day 4: Add tombstone support to ALEX
- [ ] Day 4: Update WAL for delete entries
- [ ] Day 5: Add delete tests
- [ ] Day 5: Benchmark delete performance

**Expected Performance:**
- Delete latency: ~2,000ns (similar to insert)
- Query after delete: ~900ns (check for tombstone)
- Space: Grows unbounded until compaction

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ Delete operations work correctly
- ‚úÖ Queries respect tombstones
- ‚úÖ WAL replay handles deletes
- ‚úÖ All tests passing

---

### Phase 7: Compaction (P1 - Days 6-8)

- [ ] Day 6: Implement file rebuilding
- [ ] Day 7: Add mmap remapping after compaction
- [ ] Day 7: Test compaction correctness
- [ ] Day 8: Benchmark compaction time
- [ ] Day 8: Add compaction tests

**Expected Performance:**
- Compaction time: 1-5 seconds for 1M keys
- Space reclaimed: 50-90% (depends on delete rate)
- Downtime: Offline compaction (blocks all operations)

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ Compaction removes tombstones
- ‚úÖ File size reduced
- ‚úÖ Queries work after compaction
- ‚úÖ All tests passing

---

### Phase 8: Group Commit (P1 - Days 9-10)

**Expected Performance:**
- Bulk insert: 500-1,000ns/key (2-5x improvement)
- Competitive with RocksDB (1,565ns/key)
- Latency trade-off: +10ms max for durability

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ Bulk inserts 2x+ faster
- ‚úÖ Durability maintained
- ‚úÖ All tests passing

---

### Phase 9: Range Queries (P2 - Days 11-13)

**Goal:** Efficient range scans

**Approach:** ALEX range bounds + sequential mmap scan

- [ ] Day 11: Implement ALEX range bounds
- [ ] Day 12: Handle unsorted file (scan)
- [ ] Day 12: Optimize scan (prefetching)
- [ ] Day 13: Test range queries
- [ ] Day 13: Benchmark scan throughput

**Expected Performance:**
- Range scan: 100-500ns/key (sequential mmap)
- Better for sorted keys (ALEX bounds tight)
- Worse for random keys (ALEX bounds loose)

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ Range queries work correctly
- ‚úÖ Competitive performance for sorted keys
- ‚úÖ All tests passing
