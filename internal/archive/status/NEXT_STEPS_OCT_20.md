```
Subject: PostgreSQL-compatible database with 1.5-3x faster writes

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] uses PostgreSQL for [use case]. We've built OmenDB, a
PostgreSQL-compatible database that's 1.5-3x faster for write-heavy workloads.

Key advantages:
- Drop-in PostgreSQL replacement (wire protocol compatible)
- 1.5-3x faster writes than SQLite (validated benchmarks)
- HTAP: single database for operational + analytical workloads
- 100% crash recovery validated

Would you be interested in a 10-minute demo?

Best,
[Your Name]

Demo: [link to demo video]
Benchmarks: [link to README]
```

**Deliverable**: 20 outreach emails sent, 5-10 responses

**Timeline**: 1 week

### Priority 2: Performance Optimization (Parallel Track) 🔧

**Goal**: Achieve 2x speedup at 10M scale (currently 1.9x)

**Current Bottleneck**: RocksDB (77% of query time), ALEX is only 21%

#### Option A: RocksDB Tuning (Quick Wins)

**Changes**:
1. Increase block cache size
2. Enable bloom filters
3. Tune compaction settings
4. Adjust memtable size

**Expected Improvement**: 10-20% speedup
**Timeline**: 3-5 days
**Risk**: Low (just configuration changes)

#### Option B: Query Caching

**Approach**: Cache frequent queries in memory

**Expected Improvement**: 2-3x for repeated queries
**Timeline**: 1 week
**Risk**: Medium (memory management complexity)

#### Option C: Large In-Memory Cache (Recommended)

**Approach**: Keep hot data in memory, overflow to RocksDB

**Expected Improvement**: 2-5x for hot data
**Timeline**: 1 week
**Risk**: Medium (cache invalidation complexity)

**Recommendation**: Start with **Option A (RocksDB tuning)** for quick wins, then move to **Option C** if needed.

**Deliverable**: 10M scale performance at 2x+ speedup

**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks
