# OmenDB Business Strategy

**Company**: OmenDB Inc. (to be incorporated)
**Mission**: Replace 45-year-old database technology with machine learning
**Vision**: Every database query answered by intelligence, not traversal

## Market Opportunity

### TAM Analysis
- **Database Market**: $80B (2025), growing 15% YoY
- **Index Market**: ~$50B (estimated 60% of database operations)
- **Learned Index Addressable**: $10B initially (performance-critical)
- **5-Year Target**: $1B revenue potential

### Why Now?
1. **Technology Inflection**: ML infrastructure mature (2025 vs 2018)
2. **Market Pain**: Databases hitting physical limits
3. **Competition Vacuum**: Zero production learned databases
4. **Research Complete**: 5+ years of academic validation

## Competitive Landscape

### Vector Database Market (Abandoned)
- **30+ competitors**: Pinecone, Qdrant, Weaviate, Chroma, LanceDB
- **Commoditized**: All use same algorithms (HNSW/IVF)
- **Price war**: Margins collapsing
- **Decision**: Pivot away (Sept 25, 2025)

### Learned Database Market (Our Focus)
- **Commercial competitors**: ZERO
- **Academic research**: Google, MIT, Microsoft (not productized)
- **Time advantage**: 18-24 months before big players react
- **Moat**: ML + systems expertise rare combination

### Potential Future Threats
| Company | Likelihood | Timeline | Our Defense |
|---------|------------|----------|-------------|
| Google | Medium | 2-3 years | Move fast, own developer mindshare |
| PostgreSQL | Low | 3-5 years | We'll be the standard by then |
| Oracle | Low | 5+ years | Too slow, wrong incentives |
| Startups | High | 6-12 months | First mover, open source community |

## Go-to-Market Strategy

- **LTV/CAC**: 18x

## YC Application Strategy

### Deadline: November 10, 2025 (45 days)

### The Pitch
**One-liner**: "We make databases 10x faster by replacing B-trees with AI"

**Problem**: Databases use 45-year-old algorithms (B-trees from 1979). Meanwhile, every other field has been revolutionized by ML - computer vision, NLP, robotics. Why not databases?

**Solution**: Learned indexes that understand your data distribution. Instead of blindly traversing trees, our models predict exactly where data lives in 1-2 CPU cycles.

**Demo Script** (2 min video):
1. Create PostgreSQL table with 10M rows
2. Standard B-tree index: 200ns lookups
3. Install OmenDB: `CREATE EXTENSION omendb_learned`
4. Learned index: 20ns lookups (10x faster)
5. Show real-time dashboard comparing performance

### Traction Plan (Next 45 Days)
- Week 1-2: Working prototype
- Week 3-4: PostgreSQL extension
- Week 5-6: Benchmarks + video
- Submit: November 1 (early)

### Team Story
**You**: Systems engineer, Mojo/Rust expert, built OmenDB vector database
**Needed**: ML co-founder (recruiting now)
**Advisors**: Targeting PostgreSQL committers

### Why You'll Succeed
1. **Technical**: Deep systems + ML knowledge
2. **Timing**: First mover in production
3. **Market**: Every company needs databases
4. **Vision**: Clear path to $1B company
