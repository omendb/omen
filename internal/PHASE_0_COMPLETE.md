# Phase 0: Foundation Cleanup - COMPLETE ‚úÖ

**Date**: October 21, 2025
**Duration**: 1 day
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Next Phase**: Phase 1 - MVCC Implementation (Weeks 1-3)

---

## Summary

Phase 0 successfully completed foundation cleanup and MVCC design. The codebase is now production-ready with 100% tests passing, clean documentation, and a detailed implementation plan for snapshot isolation.

---

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Critical Fixes ‚úÖ

**Fixed Failing Test** (30 minutes):
- Fixed `test_extract_primary_key_table_level` in src/constraints.rs:305
- Root cause: Inline PRIMARY KEY pattern checked before table-level pattern
- Solution: Reordered pattern matching (table-level PRIMARY KEY first)
- Result: 357/357 tests passing (was 356/357)
- Commit: `fix: PRIMARY KEY extraction for table-level constraints`

**Applied Clippy Auto-Fixes** (auto):
- Fixed 18 issues across 8 files
- Removed unused imports, fixed variable naming
- All tests still passing after fixes
- 128 warnings remain (mostly dead code, low priority)

### 2. Documentation Cleanup ‚úÖ

**Consolidated Status Reporting**:
- Created `internal/STATUS_REPORT.md` as single source of truth
- Archived 13 outdated documents (sessions, status reports, roadmaps)
- Clean structure: `archive/sessions/`, `archive/status/`, `archive/roadmaps/`
- Updated `internal/README.md` with clear navigation

**Created 0.1.0 Roadmap**:
- `internal/technical/ROADMAP_0.1.0.md` - Primary roadmap (10-12 weeks)
- Integrated ENTERPRISE_GRADE_ROADMAP.md + gap analysis
- Clarified 0.1.0 target (v1.0 comes after proven deployments)
- 6 phases: MVCC ‚Üí Security ‚Üí SQL Features ‚Üí Observability ‚Üí Backup ‚Üí Hardening

**Technical Analysis**:
- `internal/technical/ENTERPRISE_GAP_ANALYSIS_OCT_21.md` - Feature gaps identified
- `internal/technical/BENCHMARK_VARIANCE_ANALYSIS_OCT_21.md` - 3-run validation
- `internal/technical/URGENT_RANDOM_ACCESS_REGRESSION.md` - RESOLVED (outlier)

### 3. MVCC Design ‚úÖ

**Comprehensive Design Document**:
- `internal/technical/MVCC_DESIGN.md` - Full MVCC architecture
- Timestamp-based snapshot isolation (inspired by ToyDB, TiKV, PostgreSQL)
- Transaction Oracle for lifecycle management
- Versioned storage: `(key, txn_id)` ‚Üí value in RocksDB
- Visibility engine with snapshot isolation rules
- Write conflict detection (first-committer-wins)
- Garbage collection for old versions
- Integration with ALEX index (tracks latest version)
- 3-week implementation timeline with test plan

**Research Completed**:
- ToyDB: Timestamp-based MVCC in Rust
- TiKV: Percolator model, snapshot isolation
- PostgreSQL: xmin/xmax visibility
- Mini-LSM: Snapshot read implementation
- SlateDB: Optimistic transactions

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well ‚úÖ
- **Fast execution**: Completed in 1 day (planned 3-5 days)
- **Comprehensive design**: MVCC design is detailed and actionable
- **Clean codebase**: 100% tests passing, ready for major work
- **Clear focus**: Shifted from customer acquisition to technical excellence

### What Could Be Better üîÑ
- **Clippy warnings**: 128 warnings remain (low priority, mostly dead code)
- **Documentation sprawl**: Had accumulated 100+ markdown files (now cleaned)

### Key Insights üí°
- **Variance matters**: Run 1 was outlier (cold cache), multiple runs essential
- **Documentation decay**: Needed consolidation after multiple sessions
- **Focus shift**: Technical excellence first, then customers/investors
- **MVCC is critical**: Cannot ship 0.1.0 without snapshot isolation

---

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ‚úÖ
- **Test regression**: All 357 tests passing, no breakage
- **Performance**: Validated baseline (1.12x at 10M), stable
- **Documentation**: Clean organization, clear roadmap

### Medium Risk ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **MVCC complexity**: 2-3 week estimate, could take 3-4 weeks
- **Integration**: ALEX + RocksDB + MVCC interaction needs care
- **Performance overhead**: Target <20%, need to validate

### Mitigation Strategies
- **MVCC**: Start with simple timestamp approach (ToyDB model)
- **Testing**: Incremental testing throughout (not just at end)
- **Performance**: Benchmark after each change
- **Fallback**: Can ship with single-writer if MVCC takes too long
