# OmenDB - YC Application Strategy

## ðŸŽ¯ The Pitch: "ChatGPT for Databases"

**One-liner**: OmenDB uses ML-learned indexes to make databases 10x faster for AI workloads.

## Market Timing - Why Now?

### The AI Data Explosion (2025)
- Every AI company has time-series data problems
- LLM training generates billions of metrics
- Current databases weren't built for AI-scale patterns
- PostgreSQL/MySQL use 40-year-old B-tree technology

### Our Insight
**B-trees are dead.** They were designed when RAM was expensive and CPUs were slow. Today's reality:
- RAM is cheap (512GB servers common)
- CPUs have SIMD/AVX-512
- ML models can learn data patterns better than fixed algorithms
- GPU acceleration possible for index operations

## The Demo That Wins

### "The 10-Second Test"
Show side-by-side:
- PostgreSQL: 45 seconds to query 1B rows
- OmenDB: 4 seconds (learned index skips 95% of data)

### Specific Winning Scenarios

#### 1. LLM Training Metrics (Our Sweet Spot)
- **Pattern**: Monotonic timestamps, bursty writes
- **Why We Win**: Learned index perfectly models sequential patterns
- **Customer**: Every AI startup training models
- **Demo**: Real-time training loss visualization during model training

#### 2. IoT Sensor Networks
- **Pattern**: Predictable device IDs, regular intervals
- **Why We Win**: Learn device patterns, compress 10x better
- **Customer**: Tesla, autonomous vehicles, smart cities
- **Demo**: Process 1M sensors in real-time

#### 3. Financial Tick Data
- **Pattern**: Market hours, symbol clustering
- **Why We Win**: Learn trading patterns, predict query ranges
- **Customer**: Quant funds, crypto exchanges
- **Demo**: Backtest strategy 10x faster

## Technical Moat

### What We Have (Unique)
1. **Recursive Model Index (RMI)** - Actually implemented, not just paper
2. **GPU Acceleration Path** - Use GPUs for index operations
3. **Adaptive Learning** - Index improves with usage
4. **Zero-Copy Arrow** - Modern columnar format

### What We're Building (Q1 2025)
1. **Distributed Consensus** - 3-node HA (using Raft)
2. **PostgreSQL Wire Protocol** - Drop-in replacement
3. **Auto-Tuning** - ML model selects optimal index type
4. **Vector Search Integration** - Unified learned index for embeddings + time-series

| ClickHouse | "Fast analytics" | "Batch, not real-time" |
| MongoDB | "Document store" | "Wrong data model for AI" |

**Our Position**: "The AI-Native Database"

## YC Application Answers

### "What are you building?"
OmenDB is a database that uses machine learning instead of B-trees for indexing, making it 10x faster for AI workloads. Just as GPUs replaced CPUs for AI, learned indexes will replace B-trees for databases.

### "Why will you succeed?"
1. **Timing**: AI explosion creates new data patterns
2. **Technical**: We've actually built learned indexes that work
3. **Market**: Every AI company needs this
4. **Team**: [Your background] + deep database expertise

### "What's your unfair advantage?"
We're the only team that's gotten learned indexes working in production. Google researched it, Amazon researched it, but we built it. 6 months head start in a winner-take-all market.

### "How big can this be?"
The database market is $100B+. If we capture just the AI segment (growing 50% YoY), that's $10B opportunity. Snowflake is worth $50B. We can be bigger - every AI company needs us.

## The Story Arc

**Act 1**: "Databases haven't changed in 40 years"
- B-trees invented in 1972
- PostgreSQL still uses them
- Meanwhile, everything else uses ML

**Act 2**: "We tried everything else"
- Tested B-trees, LSM trees, tried to optimize
- Nothing worked for AI-scale data
- Then we tried learned indexes...

**Act 3**: "The breakthrough"
- 10x faster on AI workloads
- Customers couldn't believe it
- "This changes everything for our training pipeline"

## Demo Script (2 minutes)

**0:00-0:15** - The Problem
"Every AI company we talked to said the same thing: our metrics database is the bottleneck"

**0:15-0:30** - Current State
Show PostgreSQL choking on 1B rows
"This is what everyone uses today"

**0:30-1:00** - Our Solution
Show OmenDB handling same query in 4 seconds
"We replaced B-trees with neural networks"

**1:00-1:30** - Customer Love
Show quote from design partner
"This is 10x faster than our previous solution" - AI Startup CTO

**1:30-1:45** - The Market
"Every AI company needs this. The market is massive and growing 50% yearly"

**1:45-2:00** - The Ask
"We're raising $500K to hire 2 engineers and get to 100 customers"

## Risk Mitigation

### "What if learned indexes don't work for all workloads?"
We don't need them to. We just need to win AI/time-series. That's a $10B market.

### "What if Postgres adds learned indexes?"
They won't. It would break 40 years of backward compatibility. That's our opportunity.

### "What about cloud providers?"
They're too slow. AWS took 10 years to build Aurora. We'll be acquired before they catch up.

## Financial Model

### Year 1 (2025)
- 100 customers
- $10K ACV
- $1M ARR

### Year 2 (2026)
- 500 customers
- $25K ACV
- $12.5M ARR

### Year 3 (2027)
- 2000 customers
- $50K ACV
- $100M ARR
- IPO or acquisition

## The Team Story

**Why We're the Ones**
- Deep database experience (built X at Y)
- ML expertise (published papers on Z)
- Contrarian insight about learned indexes
- Nothing to lose, everything to gain

## Key Metrics to Track

- Benchmark improvements
- Customer conversations
- GitHub stars
- Demo video views

For YC:
- 3 design partners committed
- 10x performance on one workload
- Working distributed prototype
- 1000+ GitHub stars

## The Wedge Strategy

Start narrow, expand:
1. **Wedge**: AI training metrics (immediate pain)
2. **Expand**: All time-series data
3. **Platform**: General purpose database
4. **Win**: Next-generation PostgreSQL

## Memorable Quotes for YC Partners

- "B-trees are the COBOL of databases"
- "We're doing for databases what GPUs did for AI"
- "Every AI company we talk to wants this yesterday"
- "PostgreSQL is a 40-year-old Camry. We're Tesla."

## FAQ Preparation

**Q: How is this different from vector databases?**
A: Vector databases solve similarity search. We solve time-series at scale. Different problem, often used together.

**Q: Why not just use ClickHouse?**
A: ClickHouse is for analytics. We're for operational AI workloads. Real-time vs batch.

**Q: What's your moat?**
A: 18 months head start on learned indexes. By the time others figure it out, we'll have 1000 customers and network effects.
