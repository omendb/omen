### Critical Gaps (Production Blockers)

1. **No Panic-Free Guarantee** ‚ö†Ô∏è P0 BLOCKER
   - Many `.unwrap()` calls throughout codebase
   - Could crash in production on invalid input
   - **Impact:** Database crashes = data loss risk
   - **Fix:** Audit all unwraps, add validation (3 days)

2. **No Transactions** ‚ö†Ô∏è P0 BLOCKER
   - No ACID guarantees
   - No BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK
   - **Impact:** No isolation, data consistency issues
   - **Fix:** Implement transaction system (5 days)

3. **No JOINs** ‚ö†Ô∏è P1 BLOCKER
   - Can't query multiple tables together
   - **Impact:** Limits real-world usage severely
   - **Fix:** Implement INNER/LEFT/RIGHT joins (5 days)

4. **No UPDATE/DELETE** ‚ö†Ô∏è P1 BLOCKER
   - Can only INSERT, not modify
   - **Impact:** Can't fix data errors, append-only only
   - **Fix:** Implement MVCC + tombstones (7 days)

5. **No Connection Pooling** ‚ö†Ô∏è P1 BLOCKER
   - No connection limits
   - **Impact:** Resource exhaustion under load
   - **Fix:** Implement pooling (2 days)

6. **No Monitoring** ‚ö†Ô∏è P1 BLOCKER
   - No health checks, no metrics
   - **Impact:** Can't detect failures
   - **Fix:** Add /health, /ready, metrics (2 days)

    anyhow!("Invalid input: {}", e)
})?;  // ‚úÖ Returns proper error
```
