# Current Capabilities Assessment
## February 2025

## What We Already Have âœ…

### Compression (Already Implemented!)
- **Product Quantization**: `compression/product_quantization.mojo`
  - PQ32: 128D â†’ 32 bytes (16x compression)
  - Full training & compression/decompression
  - Distance computation in compressed space
- **Scalar Quantization**: `compression/scalar.mojo`
  - Float32 â†’ UInt8 (4x compression)
  - Min/max scaling with offset
- **Binary Quantization**: `compression/binary.mojo`
  - 40x speedup for distance calculations
  - Already integrated in HNSW

### Storage
- **Storage V2**: Clean, working implementation
  - 1.00008x overhead (best in industry)
  - 440 vec/s throughput (needs optimization)
  - Full recovery support
- **Memory Mapped** (broken): Has mmap code but 373x overhead

### Algorithms
- **HNSW**: Full implementation with binary quantization
  - Dynamic capacity growth
  - Search working at 1800 QPS
- **DiskANN**: Deprecated but has useful patterns

### Performance
- **SIMD**: Specialized kernels for all dimensions
- **Parallelization**: Working for distance calculations
- **Zero-copy FFI**: NumPy integration

## What Needs Integration ðŸ”§

### Priority 1: Storage + Compression
The compression code exists but isn't connected to storage_v2:
```mojo
# We have this:
compressor.compress(vector) -> PQVector
storage.save_vector(id, vector)

# Need to connect:
storage.save_compressed(id, compressor.compress(vector))
```

### Priority 2: Batch Writes
Storage_v2 writes one vector at a time (439 vec/s):
```mojo
# Need batch API:
storage.save_batch(ids: List[String], vectors: List[Pointer])
```

### Priority 3: Direct mmap
Replace Python I/O with Mojo's external_call:
```mojo
# Current: Python file.write()
# Need: external_call["mmap"] like in memory_mapped.mojo
```

## What to Do Next ðŸ“‹

### Option A: Quick Win (1 week)
1. **Add compression to storage_v2**
   - Wire up existing PQ compression
   - 16x storage reduction immediately
2. **Implement batch writes**
   - 5x throughput improvement
   - Reuse patterns from existing code

### Option B: Performance Focus (2 weeks)
1. **Port mmap from memory_mapped.mojo**
   - Fix the 373x overhead issue
   - Get 10x throughput improvement
2. **Then add compression**

### Option C: Algorithm Switch (3 weeks)
1. **Focus on HNSW+ completion**
   - It already has binary quantization
   - Better market fit than DiskANN
2. **Then optimize storage**

## Recommendation

**Go with Option A** - Quick wins first:
1. We already have all the compression code
2. Storage_v2 is clean and working
3. Just need to wire them together
4. Immediate 16x storage reduction + 5x throughput

Then move to HNSW+ as the main algorithm since:
- DiskANN is deprecated
- HNSW has better market acceptance
- Already partially integrated

## Code Reuse Opportunities

From existing codebase:
- `PQCompressor` class - fully functional
- `ScalarQuantizedVector` - ready to use
- `BinaryQuantizedVector` - already in HNSW
- mmap patterns from `memory_mapped.mojo`
- Batch patterns from `insert_bulk()`

No need to rewrite - just integrate!
