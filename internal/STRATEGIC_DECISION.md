- Clear performance advantage (not incremental)
- Defensible moat (ML + systems expertise rare)

## Technical Architecture: LearnedDB

### Core Innovation
Replace traditional index structures with learned models:
```
Traditional B-Tree: O(log n) lookups, 100+ cache misses
Learned Index: O(1) model inference, 1-2 cache misses
Result: 10-100x faster lookups
```

### Architecture Overview
```rust
// Three-tier learned system
pub struct LearnedDB {
    // Tier 1: Root model (small NN, predicts region)
    root_model: CachedModel<32KB>,

    // Tier 2: Regional models (linear/small NN)
    regional_models: Vec<RegionalModel>,

    // Tier 3: Leaf pages (sorted arrays + corrections)
    leaf_storage: MemoryMappedPages,

    // Adaptive layer (handles updates)
    delta_buffer: AdaptiveBuffer,
    model_retrainer: BackgroundRetrainer,
}
```

### Key Components

#### 1. Learned Index (Primary Innovation)
```rust
// 2-layer RMI (Recursive Model Index)
impl LearnedIndex {
    fn lookup(&self, key: Key) -> Value {
        // Stage 1: Root model predicts segment (1 cache line)
        let segment = self.root_model.predict(key);

        // Stage 2: Segment model predicts position (1 cache line)
        let position = self.segments[segment].predict(key);

        // Stage 3: Binary search in small range (1-2 cache lines)
        self.data.search_around(position, key)
    }
}
```

#### 2. Learned Cardinality Estimation
```rust
// Replace histograms with neural networks
impl CardinalityEstimator {
    fn estimate(&self, query: &Query) -> f64 {
        let features = extract_query_features(query);
        self.model.predict(features) // 100x more accurate
    }
}
```

#### 3. Learned Query Optimization
```rust
// ML-based cost model instead of rule-based
impl QueryOptimizer {
    fn optimize(&self, query: &Query) -> Plan {
        let candidates = generate_plans(query);
        let costs = self.cost_model.predict_batch(&candidates);
        candidates[costs.argmin()]
    }
}
```

### Performance Targets

| Operation | Traditional DB | LearnedDB | Improvement |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|-------------|
| Point Lookup | 100-200ns | 10-20ns | 10x |
| Range Scan | 1-10Œºs | 100-500ns | 10x |
| Cardinality Est. | ¬±50% error | ¬±5% error | 10x |
| Query Planning | 1-10ms | 100-500Œºs | 10x |
| Memory Usage | 10-20% data size | 1-2% data size | 10x |

## Technology Stack Decision

### Rust (Recommended ‚úÖ)

**Pros**:
- Production-ready ecosystem
- Excellent ML libraries emerging (Candle, Burn)
- Memory safety without GC overhead
- Strong PostgreSQL extension support (pgrx)
- Proven for databases (TiKV, SurrealDB, SpacetimeDB)

**Required Libraries (All Available)**:
- **ML Framework**: Candle (PyTorch-like, pure Rust)
- **Linear Algebra**: nalgebra, ndarray
- **SIMD**: std::simd (stabilizing), packed_simd
- **Storage**: memmap2, io-uring
- **PostgreSQL**: pgrx (if extension route)

### Mojo (Not Ready ‚ùå)

**Blockers**:
- No stable ecosystem (can't ship to production)
- Dict limited to 600 entries (dealbreaker)
- No PostgreSQL integration path
- Language still evolving (breaking changes)
- No ML frameworks yet

**Verdict**: Revisit in 2027 when mature

## Go-to-Market Strategy

### Phase 1: PostgreSQL Extension (Months 1-6)
```sql
CREATE EXTENSION learneddb;

-- Drop-in replacement for B-tree
CREATE INDEX learned_idx ON users USING learned(id);

-- 10x faster lookups with zero application changes
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 12345; -- 20ns vs 200ns
```

**Why PostgreSQL First**:
- Instant adoption path (no migration)
- Prove technology in production
- Build trust with performance wins
- Generate case studies

### Phase 2: Standalone System (Months 7-12)
- Full ACID-compliant database
- PostgreSQL wire protocol compatible
- Learned indexes, joins, aggregations
- Target: 100x performance on OLAP workloads

### Phase 3: Cloud Service (Year 2)
- Managed LearnedDB cloud
- Auto-retraining of models
- Multi-tenant optimization
- Usage-based pricing

## YC Pitch Narrative

### The Problem
"Databases haven't fundamentally changed since 1979. They still use B-trees, hash tables, and rule-based optimizers designed for 1MB of RAM. Meanwhile, ML has revolutionized every field it's touched - except databases."

### The Solution
"LearnedDB replaces 40-year-old algorithms with machine learning models. Instead of traversing trees with 100+ cache misses, our models predict locations in 1-2 cache lines. It's 10-100x faster while using 10x less memory."

### Why Now
"Three things converged: (1) ML infrastructure is finally production-ready, (2) Google proved this works but never productized it, (3) Every company now has data scaling problems that traditional databases can't solve."

### The Team Needed
- Systems engineer (you - Mojo/Rust experience)
- ML engineer (recruit - model optimization)
- Database expert (recruit - PostgreSQL internals)

### Traction Goals (3 months)
1. Working PostgreSQL extension
2. 10x performance on TPC-H benchmark
3. 3 production deployments
4. Open source with 1000+ stars

## 12-Month Roadmap

### Months 1-3: Foundation
- [ ] Implement basic learned index in Rust
- [ ] PostgreSQL extension wrapper
- [ ] Benchmark vs B-tree (prove 10x)
- [ ] Open source release

### Months 4-6: Production Ready
- [ ] Handle updates efficiently
- [ ] Multi-version concurrency control
- [ ] Crash recovery

- [ ] Series A prep

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Model retraining overhead**: Background retraining with delta buffers
2. **Update performance**: Hybrid approach (learned + small B-tree for updates)
3. **Worst-case guarantees**: Fallback to traditional structures when models fail

### Business Risks
1. **Education barrier**: Start as "faster PostgreSQL index"
2. **Enterprise adoption**: PostgreSQL extension = low risk trial
3. **Competition from big cos**: 2-year window before they react

## Financial Projections

### Year 1
- PostgreSQL extension: Free (adoption)
- Support contracts: $500K ARR
- Burn rate: $50K/month

### Year 2
- Cloud service: $50-500/month per customer
- Target: 100 customers = $2.4M ARR
- Series A: $10-15M

### Year 3
- Enterprise deals: $100K+ ACV
- Target: $10M ARR
- Series B candidate

## Conclusion

**LearnedDB represents the next 40-year database architecture**. While competitors fight over incremental vector search improvements, we're replacing the entire foundation with ML-native structures.

The opportunity is:
- **Technically feasible** (research proven, tools available)
- **Commercially viable** (clear adoption path via PostgreSQL)
- **Defensible** (requires rare ML + systems expertise)
- **Timely** (no competition, market needs breakthrough)

**Next Steps**:
1. Recruit ML co-founder
2. Build PostgreSQL extension MVP (4 weeks)
3. Apply to YC with working demo
4. Open source for credibility
