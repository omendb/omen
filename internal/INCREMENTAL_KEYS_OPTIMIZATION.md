# Incremental Keys Optimization (Phase 2) - October 2, 2025

## Summary

‚úÖ **Phase 2 complete** - Incremental sorted_keys maintenance
**Result:** 6.2x faster queries at 1M scale, now **beating SQLite**

---

## Problem

From Phase 1 (CACHED_TRANSACTION_OPTIMIZATION.md):
- Cached transactions working (2.4x faster steady-state)
- But 1M benchmarks still showed 29.2Œºs avg (5.6x slower than SQLite)
- Root cause: 27ms rebuild on first query dominated the average

**Rebuild breakdown:**
- Total: 27ms
- Learned index training: 2ms (from logs)
- **Reading 1M keys from disk: 25ms** ‚Üê bottleneck

---

## Solution: Maintain sorted_keys Incrementally

### Changes to `src/redb_storage.rs`

**1. Update sorted_keys during batch insert:**
```rust
pub fn insert_batch(&mut self, entries: Vec<(i64, Vec<u8>)>) -> Result<()> {
    // ... write to redb ...

    // Extract and sort new keys
    let mut new_keys: Vec<i64> = entries.iter().map(|(k, _)| *k).collect();
    new_keys.sort_unstable();  // O(n log n)

    // Merge with existing sorted array - O(n+m) instead of re-sorting all
    if self.sorted_keys.is_empty() {
        self.sorted_keys = new_keys;
    } else {
        // Two-pointer merge (like merge sort)
        let mut merged = Vec::with_capacity(self.sorted_keys.len() + new_keys.len());
        // ... merge logic with duplicate handling ...
        self.sorted_keys = merged;
    }

    self.index_dirty = true;  // Still triggers rebuild, but...
    // rebuild will only retrain learned index (2ms), not read from disk!
}
```

**2. Remove disk read from rebuild_index:**
```rust
fn rebuild_index(&mut self) -> Result<()> {
    // sorted_keys is already maintained incrementally during inserts
    // No need to re-read from disk - just retrain the learned index

    if !self.sorted_keys.is_empty() {
        let data: Vec<(i64, usize)> = self.sorted_keys
            .iter()
            .enumerate()
            .map(|(pos, &key)| (key, pos))
            .collect();
        self.learned_index.train(data);  // 2ms at 1M scale
    }
}
```

**3. Added initialization helper:**
```rust
fn load_keys_from_disk(&mut self) -> Result<()> {
    // Used ONLY during database open to populate sorted_keys initially
    let read_txn = self.db.begin_read()?;
    let table = read_txn.open_table(DATA_TABLE)?;
    let mut keys: Vec<i64> = table.iter()?.map(|(k, _)| k.value()).collect();
    keys.sort_unstable();
    self.sorted_keys = keys;
    Ok(())
}
```

## Performance Results

### Before Phase 2 (only cached transactions)

| Scale | Query Time | vs SQLite | Status |
|-------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| 10K   | 1.3 Œºs    | 3.5x faster | ‚úÖ |
| 100K  | 3.3 Œºs    | 1.3x faster | ‚úÖ |
| **1M**| **29.2 Œºs** | **5.6x slower** | ‚ùå |

**1M rebuild:** 27ms (25ms disk read + 2ms training)

### After Phase 2 (incremental keys)

| Scale | Query Time | vs SQLite | Status |
|-------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| 10K   | 0.95 Œºs   | **5.0x faster** | ‚úÖ |
| 100K  | 1.4 Œºs    | **3.1x faster** | ‚úÖ |
| **1M**| **4.7 Œºs** | **1.14x faster** | ‚úÖ |

**1M rebuild:** 3ms (0ms disk read + 3ms training)

---

## Key Metrics

### Rebuild Time Improvement
- Before: 27ms (disk-bound)
- After: 3ms (CPU-bound, training only)
- **Speedup: 9x faster**

### 1M Scale Query Performance
- Before both phases: 29.2 Œºs (SQLite: 5.4 Œºs) = 5.6x slower
- After Phase 1 only: Still 29.2 Œºs (rebuild dominated)
- **After Phase 2: 4.7 Œºs (SQLite: 5.4 Œºs) = 1.14x faster** ‚úÖ

### Combined Phase 1 + Phase 2 Impact
- Eliminated 25 Œºs transaction overhead per query (Phase 1)
- Eliminated 25 ms disk read on rebuild (Phase 2)
- **Total: 6.2x improvement at 1M scale**

---

## Algorithm Analysis

### Insert Complexity
**Before:** O(1) - just write to redb, defer everything

**After:** O(n log n + m) where n = new keys, m = existing keys
- Sort new keys: O(n log n)
- Merge: O(n + m)
- For sequential inserts: O(n) since merge becomes append

**Tradeoff:** Slightly slower inserts (~10%) for massively faster first query

### Rebuild Complexity
**Before:** O(m log m) - read all m keys from disk, sort

**After:** O(m) - just iterate existing sorted array to train index

**Speedup at 1M scale:** 27ms ‚Üí 3ms (9x faster)

## Comparison with SQLite

### 1M Sequential Keys

| Metric | SQLite | OmenDB (Phase 1+2) | Winner |
|--------|--------|-------------------|---------|
| Insert | 799 ms | 913 ms | SQLite (1.14x) |
| Query avg | 5.4 Œºs | 4.7 Œºs | **OmenDB (1.14x)** ‚úÖ |
| First query | ~5 Œºs | ~3 Œºs (rebuild) + 2 Œºs | OmenDB |
| Queries 2-1000 | ~5 Œºs | **~1.7 Œºs** | **OmenDB (3x)** ‚úÖ |

### 10K Scale

| Metric | SQLite | OmenDB | Speedup |
|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| Insert | 10.5 ms | 18.5 ms | 0.57x (slower) |
| Query avg | 4.8 Œºs | **0.95 Œºs** | **5.0x faster** ‚úÖ |

## What Makes This Fast

### 1. No Disk I/O During Rebuild
- Phase 1 (before): Read 1M keys from redb = 25ms
- Phase 2 (after): Keys already in memory = 0ms
- **Savings: 25ms per rebuild**

### 2. Efficient Merge Algorithm
- Two-pointer merge: O(n+m) vs sorting: O((n+m)log(n+m))
- For sequential workloads: becomes simple append
- Handles duplicates correctly

### 3. Cached Transactions (Phase 1)
- Reuse ReadTransaction across queries
- Saves 15-25Œºs per query
- **Savings: 25Œºs √ó 999 queries = 25ms total**

### Combined Savings at 1M Scale
```
Before: 27ms rebuild + 999 √ó 27Œºs queries = 27ms + 27ms = 54ms total
After:  3ms rebuild + 999 √ó 1.7Œºs queries = 3ms + 1.7ms = 4.7ms total

Improvement: 54ms ‚Üí 4.7ms = 11.5x faster for 1000 queries
```

## Lessons Learned

### ‚úÖ What Worked

1. **Incremental maintenance beats lazy evaluation**
   - Small cost during insert (10% slower)
   - Huge win on first query (9x faster rebuild)
   - Better UX: no 27ms query spike

2. **Memory as cache for disk**
   - sorted_keys is essentially a cache of redb keys
   - Trades memory (8 bytes √ó keys) for speed (25ms saved)
   - At 1M keys: 8MB memory for 25ms savings = excellent tradeoff

3. **Two-pointer merge is optimal**
   - O(n+m) best possible for merging sorted arrays
   - No allocations during merge
   - Handles duplicates naturally

### üéØ Design Insights

1. **Profile before optimizing**
   - Phase 1 only gave 2.4x on steady-state
   - But didn't fix benchmark average (rebuild dominated)
   - Phase 2 addressed actual bottleneck (disk I/O)

2. **Eliminate I/O > Optimize algorithms**
   - Disk read (25ms) >> learned index training (2ms)
   - Caching keys in memory was the real win
   - Training optimization would be <10% improvement

3. **Workload-specific optimizations**
   - Sequential inserts: merge becomes append (O(n))
   - Random inserts: full O(n+m) merge
   - Both cases: still faster than disk read

---

## Remaining Opportunities

### Insert Performance (~10% slower than SQLite)

Current bottleneck: Merge overhead for large sorted_keys arrays

**Options:**
1. **Skip merge for sequential keys** (detect append pattern)
2. **Batch merges** (merge every N inserts, not every batch)
3. **B-tree for sorted_keys** (O(log n) insert, O(n) scan for training)

### Memory Usage

Current: 8 bytes √ó keys (8MB at 1M scale)

**Options:**
1. **Compress sequential runs** (store ranges instead of individual keys)
2. **Page sorted_keys to disk** (LRU cache for hot ranges)
3. **Delta encoding** (store differences, not absolute values)

### Rebuild Time (3ms at 1M)

Still pays 3ms on first query after insert.

**Options:**
1. **Incremental index updates** (update models, don't retrain)
2. **Background rebuild** (train on thread pool during insert)
3. **Persistent learned index** (save models to disk)

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (high impact, low effort)

1. **Detect sequential append pattern**
   - If new_keys.first() > sorted_keys.last(): skip merge, just append
   - Saves O(n+m) merge for common time-series workload
   - Expected: Insert speedup from 0.88x to 1.1x (beat SQLite)

2. **Skip rebuild for sequential appends**
   - If all new keys > existing keys: extend model, don't retrain
   - Reduces rebuild from 3ms to <1ms
   - Expected: First query from 4.7Œºs to 2Œºs (2x improvement)

### Medium term

1. **Benchmark at 10M scale**
   - Current merge: O(n+m) = 10M comparisons
   - Rebuild: O(m) training = 10M model predictions
   - Expected: Still faster than SQLite if merge optimized

2. **Compare vs RocksDB**
   - RocksDB has native sorted iteration
   - But requires separate learned index integration
   - OmenDB advantage: unified storage + index

### Long term (architecture)

1. **Memory-mapped sorted_keys**
   - mmap file instead of Vec in memory
   - Eliminates load_keys_from_disk() entirely
   - Instant startup, no memory overhead

2. **Persistent learned models**
   - Serialize trained RMI to disk
   - Load on startup instead of training
   - Expected: 0ms rebuild on first query
