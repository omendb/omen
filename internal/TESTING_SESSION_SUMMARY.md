# Testing Session Summary - 50M Scale Analysis

**Date**: October 2025
**Focus**: Stress testing, profiling, and root cause analysis
**Status**: Complete - Led to multi-level ALEX implementation
**Note**: This analysis identified the cache locality bottleneck that was resolved by implementing multi-level architecture

---

## Executive Summary

**Goal**: Test OmenDB at scale to find breaking points and optimize for production.

**Critical Finding**: Performance degrades significantly beyond 10M scale.

**Root Cause Identified**: Excessive node splitting from auto-retrain creates:
- 16.7M leaves at 50M scale (33% of all rows!)
- Only ~3 keys per leaf
- 84% of query time spent in leaf routing (binary search on millions of split_keys)
- Result: 2.6x slower queries, even sequential inserts become slower

**Impact**:
- ✅ Safe: 1M-10M rows (2-3x faster than SQLite)
- ⚠️ Risky: 10M-50M rows (1.3x faster, degrading)
- ❌ Broken: 50M+ rows (queries slower than SQLite)

## Test Results Summary

### 50M Scale Stress Test

**Command**: `./benchmark_table_vs_sqlite 50000000`
**Duration**: ~12 minutes

| Workload | Metric | OmenDB | SQLite | Ratio | Status |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Sequential | Insert | 54.5s | 45.0s | 0.83x | ⚠️ SLOWER |
| Sequential | Query | 17.0μs | 7.3μs | 0.43x | ⚠️ SLOWER |
| Random | Insert | 84.1s | 302.6s | 3.60x | ✅ GOOD |
| Random | Query | 17.2μs | 7.5μs | 0.44x | ⚠️ SLOWER |
| **Overall** | | | | **1.32x** | ➖ NEUTRAL |

### Query Performance Trend

| Scale | OmenDB | SQLite | Ratio | Trend |
|-------|--------|--------|-------|-------|
| 1M | 2.5μs | 6.3μs | **2.5x faster** ✅ | Good |
| 10M | 6.5μs | 6.9μs | **1.1x faster** ✅ | Degrading |
| 50M | 17.0μs | 7.4μs | **0.4x SLOWER** ⚠️ | Critical |

**Projection at 100M**: ~44μs (unacceptable)

### Profiling Results

**10M Scale**:
```
Leaves: 3,333,212
Keys per leaf: 3.0
Query time: 2.39μs
Bottleneck: Leaf routing (82%)
```

**50M Scale**:
```
Leaves: 16,666,545
Keys per leaf: 3.0
Query time: 3.01μs (profiler) / 17.18μs (benchmark)
Bottleneck: Leaf routing (84%)
```

### Key Findings

1. **Excessive Splitting**: 33% of rows become separate leaves
2. **Too Many Leaves**: 16.7M leaves at 50M scale
3. **Tiny Nodes**: Only ~3 keys per leaf (inefficient)
4. **Leaf Routing Dominates**: 84% of query time in binary search
5. **Cache Misses**: Random data pattern → poor cache locality

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem: Auto-Retrain Causes Over-Splitting

**How it happens**:
1. Batch insert adds 1M rows to leaf
2. Auto-retrain() called after batch
3. Retrain sorts keys, fits perfect linear model
4. Model is SO accurate, density quickly hits MAX_DENSITY (0.8)
5. Node splits into 2 nodes
6. Repeat for every batch → exponential leaf growth

**Math**:
```
Without retrain:
- Model error high → lots of gaps needed → fewer splits
- 50M rows → ~100K leaves → 500 keys/leaf
- Query time: O(log 100K) + O(log 500) ≈ 17 + 9 = 26 comparisons

With retrain (current):
- Model error low → minimal gaps needed → frequent splits
- 50M rows → 16.7M leaves → 3 keys/leaf
- Query time: O(log 16.7M) + O(log 3) ≈ 24 + 2 = 26 comparisons

WAIT - same comparisons, why slower?
```

**Ah! The real issue**: Binary search on 16.7M split_keys has cache misses.
- 100K split_keys: Fits in L3 cache (~1MB)
- 16.7M split_keys: 133MB array, constant cache misses
- Each cache miss: ~100ns → 24 misses × 100ns = 2.4μs overhead

**Plus**:
- Random data pattern → different leaves accessed → no cache reuse
- 17μs total = 3μs computation + 14μs cache misses ✓

### Why Sequential Inserts are Slower

**10M scale**: 1.50x faster inserts
**50M scale**: 0.83x slower inserts

**Cause**: Retrain overhead
```
Retrain cost: O(n log n) per leaf
50M rows / 16.7M leaves = 3 keys/leaf
16.7M retrains × O(3 log 3) = 16.7M × 4.75 ops = 79M ops

Plus sorting overhead in batch_insert:
50M rows × log(50M) = 50M × 25.6 = 1.28B ops

Total: 1.36B ops vs SQLite's B-tree inserts
```

---

## Why the Profiler Shows 3μs but Benchmark Shows 17μs

**Profiler (Sequential Data)**:
- Inserts: 0, 1, 2, ..., 50M (in order)
- Queries: Every 5000th key (sequential)
- Result: 3.01μs (good cache locality)

**Benchmark (Random UUIDs)**:
- Inserts: Shuffled random UUIDs
- Queries: Random samples across key space
- Result: 17.18μs (cache misses)

**Difference**: 5.7x = Cache locality
- Sequential: Same leaves accessed repeatedly → cached
- Random: Different leaves every query → cache miss
- 14μs overhead from cache misses ✓

---

## Implications

### For Production

**Validated Safe Range**: 1M-10M rows
- 2-3x faster overall
- Queries 1.1-2.8x faster
- Write-heavy: 3.6-4.7x faster inserts

**Problematic Range**: 10M-50M rows
- 1.3x faster overall (degrading)
- Queries 0.4x (SLOWER)
- Only viable for write-only workloads

**Not Recommended**: 50M+ rows
- Queries much slower than SQLite
- Sequential inserts slower
- Fundamental architecture issue

### For Competitive Claims

**Before Testing**:
- Claimed: "2-3x faster at 1M-10M scale" ✅
- Projected: "Scales linearly to 100M+" ❌

**After Testing**:
- Validated: "2-3x faster at 1M-10M scale" ✅
- Reality: "Degrades beyond 10M, broken at 50M+" ⚠️
- **Cannot claim "production-ready for large datasets"**

## Potential Fixes

### Fix 1: Increase MAX_DENSITY

**Idea**: Allow more keys per node before splitting

**Implementation**:
```rust
const MAX_DENSITY: f64 = 0.95; // Was 0.8
```

**Expected Impact**:
- Fewer splits → fewer leaves
- Larger nodes → more linear scan overhead
- Net: May balance out, need testing

**Risk**: Too high density → frequent shifts → slow inserts

### Fix 2: Reduce Retrain Frequency

**Idea**: Only retrain when model error exceeds threshold

**Implementation**:
```rust
// Only retrain if model error > threshold
if model.max_error() > ERROR_THRESHOLD {
    leaf.retrain()?;
}
```

**Expected Impact**:
- Fewer retrains → faster inserts
- Less accurate models → larger exponential search radius
- Fewer splits → fewer leaves

**Risk**: Worse query performance if model inaccurate

### Fix 3: Pack Keys After Retrain

**Idea**: Remove gaps after retrain to enable binary search

**Implementation**:
```rust
fn retrain_and_pack(&mut self) {
    self.retrain();
    self.remove_gaps(); // Compact array
}
```

**Expected Impact**:
- Binary search within nodes: O(log n) vs O(n)
- 500 keys/node: 500 comparisons → 9 comparisons (55x faster!)
- But: Next insert requires full rebuild

**Risk**: Destroys gapped array benefit for inserts

### Fix 4: Multi-Level ALEX Tree

**Idea**: Add inner nodes for routing, keep leaf nodes small

**Implementation**: Major refactor (2-4 weeks)

**Expected Impact**:
- Better scaling to 100M+
- Logarithmic routing complexity
- Industry-standard solution

**Risk**: Complex implementation, may introduce bugs

## Final Results

### Fix Implemented

**Root Cause**: `split()` unconditionally retrained both nodes after splitting, creating perfectly accurate models that caused cascading splits.

**Solution**: Removed unconditional retrain from `split()`, combined with adaptive retraining (`needs_retrain()`) and MAX_DENSITY=0.95.

### 50M Scale Results (After Fix)

**Tree Structure Improvement:**
- Leaves: 16.7M → **2.8M** (6x reduction!)
- Keys/leaf: 3 → **18** (6x improvement!)

**Profiler Results (Sequential Data):**
- Query time: 3.01μs → **1.91μs** (37% faster!)
- Insert throughput: 3.6M → 4.1M rows/sec (14% faster)

**Benchmark Results (Random UUIDs):**
- Overall: 1.32x → **1.39x** (+5%)
- Random: 2.02x → **2.11x** (+4%)
- Sequential: 0.61x → **0.68x** (+11%)
- Queries: 17-18μs → **16-17μs** (5-13% faster)

### Honest Assessment

**✅ Production-Ready Scale**: 1M-10M rows
- 2.6x faster overall vs SQLite
- 1.0-1.8μs queries
- Efficient node utilization (18 keys/leaf)

**⚠️ Marginal Scale**: 10M-50M rows
- Only 1.39x faster overall (below 2.0x target)
- 16-17μs queries (2x slower than SQLite)
- Only viable for write-heavy workloads (3.7x faster inserts)

**❌ Not Recommended**: 50M+ rows
- Cache locality bottleneck dominates
- Queries 2x slower than SQLite
- **Requires multi-level ALEX architecture**

### Root Cause: Cache Locality

**Profiler vs Benchmark Gap:**
- Profiler (sequential): 1.91μs ✅
- Benchmark (random UUIDs): 17.1μs ⚠️
- **Gap**: 8.9x slower due to cache misses

**Why:**
- 2.8M leaves = 22MB split_keys array (exceeds L3 cache)
- Binary search requires log₂(2.8M) = 21 comparisons
- Random queries → 21 cache misses per query @ 100ns each = 2.1μs overhead
- Plus exponential search + linear scan = 17μs total ✓
