## 🚀 Current State

### Performance & Quality Metrics
```yaml
Architecture:     Segmented HNSW (2 segments, individual insertion)
Insertion Rate:   3,332 vec/s (2500 vectors, segmented)
                  5,329 vec/s (1000 vectors, monolithic with SIMD)
                  867 vec/s (baseline with quality)
Search Latency:   2.57ms (segmented, 2500 vectors)
                  8.2ms (monolithic baseline)
Recall Quality:   100% (segmented with individual insertion)
                  0% (bulk construction - BROKEN)
Memory Safety:    ✅ Zero crashes (lazy initialization fix)
Build Status:     ✅ Passing (warnings only)
Test Coverage:    ~40% (core algorithms tested)
```

### Production Readiness
```yaml
Status: NOT PRODUCTION READY
Gap: Need 20K+ vec/s with 90%+ recall
Current Best: 3.3K vec/s with 100% recall (6x gap)
Blockers:
  - Bulk insertion creates disconnected graphs (0% recall)
  - No real parallelism (everything sequential)
  - Segmented HNSW breaks at scale (3K+ vectors)
```

## 📊 Recent Progress

### Week of September 16-19, 2025

#### ✅ What Worked
1. **Memory Corruption Fix** (Sept 18)
   - Problem: SegmentedHNSW crashed with invalid pointers
   - Solution: Lazy initialization - delay HNSWIndex creation
   - Result: 100% stable, zero crashes

2. **SIMD Optimization** (Sept 18)
   - Problem: Using slow scalar distance functions
   - Solution: Fixed calls to use `_fast_distance_between_nodes()`
   - Result: 6.15x speedup (867 → 5,329 vec/s)

3. **Segmented HNSW Quality Fix** (Sept 19)
   - Problem: Segments returned bad matches (12% recall)
   - Solution: Quality filtering + individual insertion
   - Result: 100% recall at 3.3K vec/s

4. **ef_construction Optimization** (Sept 19)
   - Changed from 200 → 100 → 50 (Qdrant setting)
   - Expected: 2-4x speedup with minimal quality loss

#### ❌ What Didn't Work
1. **Bulk Insertion Optimization**
   - Attempted: Sophisticated bulk construction
   - Result: 0% recall - creates disconnected graphs
   - Lesson: Can't skip hierarchical navigation

2. **Parallel Graph Updates**
   - Attempted: Lock-free parallel insertion
   - Result: 0.1% recall - race conditions
   - Lesson: Need independent segments, not shared graph

3. **High ef_construction Values**
   - Used: ef_construction=200 (overkill)
   - Impact: 2-4x slower than necessary
   - Fixed: Now using 50 (Qdrant benchmark setting)

## 🎯 Active Work

### Currently Implementing
**DiskANN Two-Phase Bulk Construction**
- Phase 1: Parallel distance computation (85% of time)
- Phase 2: Sequential graph building (15% of time)
- Expected: 8-12K vec/s with 95% recall

### Next Priority
**True Segment Parallelism (Qdrant Architecture)**
- Build independent HNSW graphs per segment
- No shared state between segments
- Merge results at query time
- Expected: 15-25K vec/s with 90%+ recall

## 🚧 Blockers

### Critical Issues
1. **Bulk Construction Broken**
   - Any bulk insertion → 0% recall
   - Root cause: Skips hierarchical navigation
   - Impact: Limited to 3.3K vec/s with individual insertion

2. **No Real Parallelism**
   - "Parallel" code runs sequentially
   - Segments processed one at a time
   - Impact: Not utilizing available cores

3. **Scalability Problem**
   - Segmented HNSW breaks at 3K+ vectors
   - Accumulation causes 0% recall
   - Need better segment management

## 📈 Performance Evolution

### Baseline → Current
```
Day 0 (Baseline):        867 vec/s, 95.5% recall
Day 1 (Profiling):       No change (identified bottlenecks)
Day 2 (SIMD attempt):    0% improvement (wrong approach)
Day 3 (Memory fix):      Stable but no speed gain
Day 4 (SIMD fix):        5,329 vec/s, 95% recall (6.15x!)
Day 5 (Segmented):       3,332 vec/s, 100% recall
Current:                 3,332 vec/s, 100% recall

Peak (broken):           27,604 vec/s, 1% recall (unusable)
```

### Competitive Landscape
| Database | Performance | Our Gap | Achievable? |
|----------|------------|---------|-------------|
| Chroma | 3-5K vec/s | ✅ Matched | Yes |
| Weaviate | 15-25K vec/s | 4.5-7.5x | Yes with segments |
| Qdrant | 20-50K vec/s | 6-15x | Yes with optimization |
| Pinecone | 10-30K vec/s | 3-9x | Yes |
| Milvus | 30-60K vec/s | 9-18x | Requires GPU |

## 🔬 Technical Discoveries

### Why Bulk Insertion Fails
1. HNSW requires navigating from entry_point down through layers
2. Bulk insertion tries to connect nodes directly at target layer
3. This creates disconnected subgraphs
4. Result: 27K vec/s but only 1% recall

### Why Segments Work
1. Each segment is an independent HNSW graph
2. No dependencies between segments during construction
3. Can build truly in parallel
4. Query merges results from all segments

### Optimization Hierarchy (by impact)
1. **Segment parallelism**: 4-8x speedup
2. **Proper bulk construction**: 2-3x speedup
3. **SIMD optimization**: 1.5-2x speedup (already done)
4. **Zero-copy FFI**: 1.5x speedup
5. **Parameter tuning**: 1.2-2x speedup (ef=50 done)

## 🛠️ Infrastructure

### Build System
- **Platform**: macOS Apple Silicon (M3)
- **Language**: Mojo 24.5
- **Package Manager**: Pixi
- **Python**: 3.12 with NumPy
- **Status**: ✅ Building successfully

### Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Basic coverage for core algorithms
- **Benchmarks**: final_validation.py (main metric)
- **Quality Tests**: Recall validation at various scales
- **CI/CD**: Not yet configured

## 📝 Lessons Learned

### Architecture Insights
1. **Segments > Parallelism**: Independent segments beat shared graph
2. **Quality > Speed**: 100% recall at 3K better than 0% at 27K
3. **Parameters Matter**: ef_construction=50 not 200
4. **Hierarchical Navigation**: NEVER skip layer traversal

### Mojo-Specific Findings
1. **SIMD works**: When using correct functions
2. **Memory management critical**: Lazy init prevents corruption
3. **No GPU support**: Pure CPU optimization only
4. **FFI overhead significant**: 10% penalty without zero-copy
