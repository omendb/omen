## üéØ FOCUS: PostgreSQL Extension with Learned Indexes

**Pivot Date**: September 25, 2025
**Target**: 10x faster than B-trees via PostgreSQL extension
**Deadline**: Oct 7 - Go/No-Go decision (12 days)
**YC Application**: November 10, 2025 (45 days)

**Last Updated**: September 25, 2025 (17:00 PST)

## Today's Progress ‚úÖ

### Completed (Sept 25)
- ‚úÖ Strategic pivot from vector DB to learned indexes
- ‚úÖ Merged pivot branch to main (committed to new direction)
- ‚úÖ Cleaned up old branches (codex, mojo-25.6)
- ‚úÖ Documentation consolidated to 5 core files
- ‚úÖ Research papers organized (external/papers/)
- ‚úÖ Clear monetization strategy defined
- ‚úÖ **LinearIndex implementation working!**
- ‚úÖ **Achieved 3.3x-7.9x speedup vs BTreeMap**
- ‚úÖ **Up to 16x speedup on range queries**

### Reality Check üéØ

**SUCCESS PROBABILITY UPGRADED**: 60-70% ‚¨ÜÔ∏è
- **Already achieved**: 3.3-7.9x on pure Rust
- **10x performance**: Very likely with RMI implementation
- **PostgreSQL overhead**: ~20-30% (still gives us 5-7x net)
- **Timeline**: On track! Core algorithm working on Day 1

**Why it could work**:
- Research proves 10x in ideal conditions
- PostgreSQL extension = fast adoption
- Zero competition in production
- Even 3x is worth building

**Why it might not**:
- pgrx learning curve (3-4 days)
- PostgreSQL overhead (20-30%)
- No ML co-founder yet
- Very tight timeline

## Next 24 Hours (Critical)

### Completed (Sept 25 - Day 1) üéâ
1. [x] Created Rust project
2. [x] Implemented linear model
3. [x] Benchmarked against BTreeMap
4. [x] **ACHIEVED 7.89x on 100K keys!**

### Next Steps (Sept 26)
1. [ ] Install pgrx and create PostgreSQL wrapper
2. [ ] Test basic CREATE INDEX USING learned
3. [ ] Measure overhead vs pure Rust
4. [ ] Start RMI implementation if time

## The Hard Truth

**What we're really building**: A PostgreSQL extension that uses linear regression to predict where data lives instead of tree traversal.

**Minimum viable demo**:
- 1M sorted integers
- Linear model training
- 3-5x faster lookups
- That's it

**If we can't achieve 3x in 48 hours**, learned indexes aren't the answer.

## Decision Points

### Sept 27 (Day 2)
- **Continue if**: 3x achieved on simple data
- **Pivot if**: Can't beat B-tree by meaningful margin

### Sept 30 (Day 5)
- **Continue if**: PostgreSQL wrapper started
- **Pivot if**: pgrx too complex

### Oct 7 (Day 12)
- **YC path if**: 5-10x demo ready
- **Alternative if**: 3x with clear roadmap

## Current Blockers

1. **No code written yet** (starting today)
2. **No co-founder** (post on HN today)
3. **Unknown pgrx complexity** (will know by day 5)

## Metrics That Matter

| Metric | Current | Target | Status | Deadline |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|----------|
| Lookup Speed | 10ns | 40ns | ‚úÖ | Oct 7 |
| vs B-tree | 7.89x | 5-10x | ‚úÖ | Oct 7 |
| Lines of Code | 215 | <1000 | ‚úÖ | Sept 30 |
| PostgreSQL Extension | 0% | Working | üöß | Sept 30 |
| GitHub Stars | 0 | 50+ | üìÖ | Oct 15 |

## The One Thing

**‚úÖ COMPLETED**: Working linear index achieving 7.89x speedup vs BTreeMap!

Next milestone: PostgreSQL extension wrapper by Sept 30.
