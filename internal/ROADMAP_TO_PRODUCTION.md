## üìä Progress Tracking

### Testing Progress
```
Current: 44 tests (81% pass)
Target:  300+ tests (100% pass)
Gap:     256 tests to write
```

### Code Coverage Progress
```
Current: ~20% (estimated)
Target:  80% minimum
Gap:     Need coverage tooling + 60% more coverage
```

### Performance Validation
```
Current: 1M keys tested
Target:  1B keys tested
Gap:     1000x scale testing needed
```

### Operational Maturity
```
Current: Manual deployment only
Target:  Full GitOps + monitoring
Gap:     Everything
```

## üö¶ Go/No-Go Decision Points

### Alpha Release (Week 3)
**Go if:**
- All tests passing
- 50M keys working
- Monitoring active

**No-go if:**
- Any test failures
- Memory leaks
- Performance regression

### Beta Release (Week 6)
**Go if:**
- 80% coverage
- Chaos tests pass
- Docs complete

**No-go if:**
- Security vulnerabilities
- Data loss bugs
- Poor performance

### Production Release (Week 10)
**Go if:**
- Security audit clean
- 99.99% uptime proven
- Customer pilot successful

**No-go if:**
- Any critical bugs
- Security concerns
- Performance issues

---

## üé™ Alternative: "YC Demo Track"

If we need to demo for YC in 2 weeks:

### Week 1: Polish the Demo
- Fix only customer-visible bugs
- Create impressive demo scripts
- Build beautiful dashboard
- Optimize for specific queries

### Week 2: Package for Demo
- Docker compose setup
- One-click deploy
- Sample datasets
- Performance charts

**Warning**: This creates technical debt and is NOT production ready

---

## üìà Competitive Timeline

| Database | Time to Production |
|----------|-------------------|
| MongoDB | 2 years |
| Cassandra | 3 years |
| ClickHouse | 2 years |
| Qdrant | 1.5 years |
| **OmenDB** | **10 weeks (aggressive)** |

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks to Timeline

1. **Algorithmic issues at scale** - RMI may degrade
2. **Concurrency bugs** - Hard to find and fix
3. **Memory management** - Rust complexities
4. **Performance cliffs** - Unexpected slowdowns
5. **Security vulnerabilities** - Require redesign

---

## üí∞ Resource Requirements

### To Hit 10-Week Timeline Need:
- 2-3 senior engineers (currently 1?)
- Dedicated QA engineer
- DevOps engineer
- Technical writer
- Security consultant

### With Current Resources:
- Realistic timeline: 16-20 weeks
- Higher risk of bugs
- Less comprehensive testing

---

## üéØ Recommendation

**Don't rush to production.**

The 8.39x speedup is meaningless if we:
- Lose customer data
- Have security breaches
- Can't scale reliably
- Have poor operations

Take 10-12 weeks to do it right. The algorithm breakthrough gives us a competitive advantage, but only if we build a reliable product around it.
