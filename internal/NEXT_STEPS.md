# OmenDB Next Steps - October 2025

## Current Status Summary

### ‚úÖ What's Working
1. **Performance validated**: 2.6x faster than SQLite at 1-10M scale
2. **Write performance**: 6x faster random inserts (killer feature)
3. **HTAP architecture**: Unified OLTP/OLAP works
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite (concurrent, edge cases, benchmarks)
5. **Documentation**: Honest, thorough technical docs

### ‚ùå Critical Gaps
1. **Scale limitation**: Performance degrades at 50M+ rows
2. **No PostgreSQL protocol**: Can't be drop-in replacement
3. **No customer validation**: Zero production deployments
4. **Limited SQL**: Missing advanced features
5. **No distribution**: Single-node only

---

## Immediate Priorities (Next 2 Weeks)

### 1. Fix Scale Limitation ‚ö° CRITICAL
**Problem**: Queries 2x slower than SQLite at 50M rows
**Solution**: Implement multi-level ALEX architecture
**Timeline**: 2-4 weeks
**Impact**: Restore 2x+ performance at 100M+ scale

```rust
// Current: Single-level (bottleneck at scale)
AlexTree {
    leaves: Vec<GappedNode>,  // 2.8M at 50M rows
    split_keys: Vec<i64>,     // 22MB, cache misses
}

// Target: Multi-level (cache-friendly)
AlexTree {
    inner_nodes: Vec<InnerNode>,  // ~1000 nodes, fits in L2
    leaves: Vec<GappedNode>,       // 2.8M leaves
}
```

### 2. PostgreSQL Wire Protocol üîå CRITICAL
**Problem**: Can't compete with CockroachDB/SingleStore
**Solution**: Implement PostgreSQL wire protocol
**Timeline**: 2-4 weeks
**Impact**: Unlock $22B PostgreSQL market

Key features needed:
- Simple Query Protocol
- Extended Query Protocol
- COPY protocol for bulk loads
- Basic prepared statements

### 3. Benchmark vs Real Competitors üìä
**Problem**: Only tested against SQLite
**Solution**: Benchmark against CockroachDB, SingleStore, TiDB
**Timeline**: 1 week
**Workloads**: YCSB, TPC-C lite, time-series

---

## 30-Day Roadmap

### Week 1-2: Multi-level ALEX
- [ ] Design inner node structure
- [ ] Implement tree traversal (inner ‚Üí leaf)
- [ ] Add splitting logic for inner nodes
- [ ] Benchmark at 50M, 100M scale
- [ ] Target: 2x+ faster than SQLite at 100M

### Week 3-4: PostgreSQL Protocol
- [ ] Implement wire protocol handler
- [ ] Add query parser integration
- [ ] Test with psql, pgbench
- [ ] Validate with top 5 ORMs
- [ ] Document migration guide

### Week 5-6: Competitive Validation
- [ ] Setup CockroachDB, SingleStore trials
- [ ] Run YCSB benchmarks
- [ ] Run TPC-C lite workload
- [ ] Document results honestly
- [ ] Identify remaining gaps

---

## 90-Day Strategic Goals

### Technical Goals
1. **100M row performance**: 2x+ faster than SQLite
2. **PostgreSQL compatible**: Works with Prisma, SQLAlchemy, etc.
3. **Production hardening**: Crash recovery, backup/restore
4. **Distributed POC**: Basic sharding/replication

### Business Goals
1. **10 production deployments**: Real customers using OmenDB
2. **1 enterprise POC**: Fortune 500 evaluation
3. **Open source launch**: GitHub release, HN launch
4. **Seed funding**: $2-5M for team building

---

## Competitive Strategy

### Our Niche: "PostgreSQL for Write-Heavy Workloads"

**Target Customer Profile:**
- PostgreSQL users
- Write-heavy workloads (IoT, time-series, events)
- 1M-100M rows
- Need real-time analytics
- Don't need massive scale (yet)

**Value Proposition:**
"6x faster writes than PostgreSQL with built-in real-time analytics"

**Proof Points Needed:**
1. Benchmark showing 6x writes vs PostgreSQL
2. Customer case study (IoT or time-series)
3. PostgreSQL migration tool
4. Performance at 100M rows

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
| Risk | Mitigation | Timeline |
|------|------------|----------|
| Multi-level ALEX doesn't scale | Fallback to B-tree at 100M+ | 2 weeks test |
| PostgreSQL protocol too complex | Start with subset, iterate | MVP in 2 weeks |
| Competitors improve faster | Focus on learned index moat | Continuous |

### Market Risks
| Risk | Mitigation | Timeline |
|------|------------|----------|
| No product-market fit | Pivot to embedded use case | 3 months |
| Can't raise funding | Bootstrap with consulting | Immediate |
| Crushed by incumbents | Focus on specific niche | Ongoing |

---

## Success Metrics

### Technical (30 days)
- [ ] 100M rows at 2x+ SQLite performance
- [ ] PostgreSQL wire protocol working
- [ ] Benchmarks vs CockroachDB complete

### Business (90 days)
- [ ] 10 production deployments
- [ ] 1 paying customer
- [ ] 1000 GitHub stars
- [ ] Seed term sheet

---

## Action Items This Week

### Monday-Tuesday
- [ ] Start multi-level ALEX design doc
- [ ] Research PostgreSQL wire protocol
- [ ] Setup CockroachDB for testing

### Wednesday-Thursday
- [ ] Implement inner node structure
- [ ] Begin wire protocol implementation
- [ ] Run first competitive benchmark

### Friday
- [ ] Test multi-level at 10M scale
- [ ] Document progress
- [ ] Plan next week

---

## Resources Needed

### Technical
- PostgreSQL protocol spec
- CockroachDB/SingleStore trial accounts
- YCSB benchmark suite
- TPC-C implementation

### Business
- Technical writer for docs
- Designer for website
- Advisor with database experience
- Intros to potential customers

---

## Bottom Line

**We have a solid technical foundation but need market validation urgently.**

Critical path:
1. Fix scale limitation (2 weeks)
2. Add PostgreSQL compatibility (2 weeks)
3. Get 10 customers (1 month)
4. Raise seed funding (2 months)

If we can't get customers in 90 days, consider:
- Pivot to embedded database market (compete with SQLite/DuckDB)
- License technology to existing database company
- Join established database team

The technology is sound. The market fit needs validation.
