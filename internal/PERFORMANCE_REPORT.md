# OmenDB Performance Report
## February 2025

## Executive Summary

**Achieved 2.2x speedup** by integrating storage_v3, but **not the expected 10x**. 

### Current Performance
- **Write**: 2,776 vec/s (was 1,307)
- **Read**: 900 QPS (was 1,800 - regression!)
- **Gap to best**: 30x (was 64x)
- **Memory**: Still excellent with 96x compression

## What We Did

### 1. Updated Documentation
- ✅ nijaru/agent-contexts with Mojo v25.5 patterns
- ✅ Internal development status docs
- ✅ Decision to stay on Mojo v25.4 (stability over features)

### 2. Integrated storage_v3
- ✅ Created VectorStorageV3 wrapper
- ✅ Connected to native.mojo
- ✅ Bypassed Python FFI in storage layer
- ⚠️ Wrapper still has FFI overhead

### 3. Performance Testing
- ✅ Validated 2.2x write improvement
- ❌ Read performance regressed
- ❌ Checkpoint/recovery broken

## Why Only 2x Instead of 10x?

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Wrapper overhead**: VectorStorageV3 still uses PythonObject
2. **Incomplete integration**: Using SimpleMMapStorage, not full DirectMMapStorage
3. **No parallelization**: Single-threaded operations
4. **Quantization overhead**: Inline compression adds latency

### Bottleneck Location
```mojo
# In storage_v3_wrapper.mojo
self.py_builtins = Python.import_module("builtins")  # Still Python!
```

## Path to 10x Performance

### Immediate (1 day)
1. **Remove wrapper layer**
   - Direct integration of storage_v3
   - No Python objects in hot path
   - Expected: 5x improvement

2. **Fix parallelization**
   ```mojo
   @parameter
   fn parallel_compress(i: Int):
       compressed[i] = compress(vectors[i])
   parallelize[parallel_compress](batch_size)
   ```

3. **Pre-allocate buffers**
   - Reuse compression buffers
   - Memory pool for vectors

### Medium Term (1 week)
1. **Complete HNSW+ implementation**
2. **Optimize search path**
3. **Fix checkpoint/recovery**

## Competitive Analysis

### Current Standing
| Metric | OmenDB | Industry Best | Gap |
|--------|--------|---------------|-----|
| Write | 2,776 vec/s | 83,000 (Milvus) | 30x |
| Read | 900 QPS | 20,000 (Qdrant) | 22x |
| Memory | 32 bytes | 230 (Milvus) | 7x better! |

### What's Working
- ✅ Memory efficiency (best in industry)
- ✅ Compression ratio (96x)
- ✅ Architecture sound

### What's Not
- ❌ Still has Python FFI overhead
- ❌ No parallelization
- ❌ Search performance regression

## Critical Decisions

### Should We Continue?
**YES** - The architecture is sound:
- 2.2x improvement proves concept
- Clear path to 10x (remove wrapper)
- Memory efficiency unmatched

### Next Sprint Priority
1. **Remove wrapper layer** (biggest impact)
2. **Fix search regression** (user experience)
3. **Complete HNSW+** (algorithm improvement)

## Code Quality Assessment

### What's Good
- Clean separation of concerns
- Modular storage layers
- Well-documented limitations

### What Needs Work
- Too many abstraction layers
- Incomplete error handling
- Missing benchmarks

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Profile the wrapper** - Find exact FFI calls
2. **Direct integration** - Skip VectorStorageV3
3. **Batch everything** - Amortize all overhead

### Architecture Changes
```mojo
# Current (slow)
native.mojo → VectorStorageV3 → SimpleMMapStorage → mmap

# Target (fast)
native.mojo → DirectMMapStorage → mmap
```

### Success Metrics
- [ ] 10,000 vec/s write
- [ ] 5,000 QPS read
- [ ] 100K vectors stable
- [ ] Checkpoint working

## Bottom Line

**Progress made but not enough.** We proved storage_v3 works but the wrapper kills performance. Direct integration should achieve the 10x target.

### The Good
- 2.2x improvement validates approach
- Memory efficiency best in class
- Clear path forward

### The Bad
- Only 2.2x not 10x
- Search regression
- Recovery broken

### The Critical
**One more day** of direct integration work should achieve 10,000 vec/s target.
