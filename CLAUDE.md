# OmenDB Development Context - REALITY CHECK

## üö® Critical Status (September 26, 2025)

**POC Results**: Learned indexes are **10x SLOWER** than B-trees
**Completion**: ~5% (mostly documentation)
**Viability**: Unproven - core thesis may be wrong
**Decision Required**: Pivot, reframe, or stop

## What We've Learned (The Hard Way)

### Failed Assumptions
1. **Learned indexes beat B-trees** ‚ùå - They're 10x slower in practice
2. **We can achieve 41M QPS** ‚ùå - That's fantasy, real SOTA is 3-7M QPS
3. **Hot/cold architecture helps** ‚ùå - Still slower than pure RocksDB
4. **General KV needs improvement** ‚ùå - DragonflyDB already solved this

### Actual Competition Performance
- **DragonflyDB**: 3.8M QPS (25x faster than Redis)
- **RocksDB**: 4.5-7M QPS (embedded)
- **Qdrant/Pinecone**: Sub-30ms on millions of vectors
- **DuckDB**: 100x faster on analytics than PostgreSQL

```

## Three Realistic Paths Forward

### Path 1: Pivot to Vector Search (Most Viable)
**Why**: We have HNSW code, growing market, clear use case
```bash
# Test current HNSW performance
cd omendb/engine
pixi run python benchmarks/final_validation.py
# Currently: 867 vec/s (need 20,000+)
```
**Timeline**: 8-12 weeks to competitive MVP
**Competition**: Qdrant, Pinecone, Weaviate
**Our Edge**: Mojo performance potential (if it matures)

### Path 2: Specialized Time-Series (Needs Validation)
**Why**: Learned indexes MIGHT work on purely sequential data
```bash
# Must prove 2x advantage first
python test_sequential_workload.py
```
**Timeline**: 12-16 weeks IF concept proven
**Competition**: InfluxDB, TimescaleDB, QuestDB
**Our Edge**: Unknown - needs testing

### Path 3: Stop and Use Existing Solutions
**Why**: Problem already solved better by others
- Use DragonflyDB for KV performance
- Use Qdrant for vector search
- Use DuckDB for analytics
- Focus efforts on application layer

## Honest Development Checklist

### Week 1: Prove or Disprove (CRITICAL)
- [ ] Test learned indexes on pure sequential data
- [ ] Must achieve 2x speedup over B-tree or STOP
- [ ] Test HNSW against Qdrant benchmarks
- [ ] Get 3 potential customers to validate need
- [ ] Make go/no-go decision by Friday

### Week 2: Build on Giants (IF continuing)
- [ ] Use DuckDB as query engine (already optimized)
- [ ] Use Apache Arrow for storage (industry standard)
- [ ] Add our specialized index as plugin
- [ ] Implement Redis wire protocol
- [ ] Achieve 100K+ QPS or STOP

### Week 3: Optimize Critical Path
- [ ] Profile actual bottlenecks (not guessing)
- [ ] SIMD optimize hot paths
- [ ] Implement parallel operations
- [ ] Must reach 500K+ QPS or pivot

### Week 4: Production Readiness
- [ ] Persistence and crash recovery
- [ ] Docker and K8s packaging
- [ ] Basic monitoring/metrics
- [ ] 3+ paying customers or stop

## Technical Reality

### What Actually Works
```python
# Hash tables beat everything for point lookups
dict_lookup: 36-47x faster than SQLite

# B-trees are best all-around
sqlite: Consistent performance across all patterns

# DuckDB dominates analytics
duckdb: 100x faster on aggregations

# Learned indexes fail
learned: 10x SLOWER than B-trees
```

### Our Actual Assets (Salvageable)
1. **Mojo HNSW**: 867 vec/s (needs 20x improvement)
2. **PyO3 bindings**: Reusable for any Rust DB
3. **PostgreSQL extension**: Educational toy
4. **Lessons learned**: What doesn't work

## Query Language & Compatibility

### IF We Continue - Pick ONE
```sql
-- Option 1: Redis Protocol (instant ecosystem)
SET key value
VECSEARCH embedding [0.1, 0.2, ...] K=10

-- Option 2: SQL Subset (familiar but complex)
SELECT * FROM vectors
ORDER BY distance(embedding, [0.1, 0.2, ...])
LIMIT 10;

-- Option 3: Custom (no ecosystem)
vec.search([0.1, 0.2, ...], k=10)
```

### Data Format Requirements
- **Must have**: JSON, MessagePack, Parquet
- **Storage**: Apache Arrow (zero-copy, SIMD)
- **Wire protocol**: Redis or PostgreSQL (not both)

## Language Bindings Priority
1. **Python** ‚úÖ (PyO3 done but untested)
2. **JavaScript** (required for web)
3. **Go** (cloud native requirement)
4. **Rust** (native performance)

## Performance Requirements (Realistic)

### Minimum Viable
- 100K QPS (currently ~10K)
- <10ms p99 latency
- 1GB/s scan rate
- Zero data loss

### Competitive
- 1M+ QPS
- <1ms p99 latency
- 10GB/s scan rate
- Horizontal scaling

## Critical Decision Points

### After Week 1 (October 3, 2025)
**STOP if:**
- Learned indexes not 2x faster on ANY workload
- No customer validation
- Can't beat existing solutions

### After Week 2 (October 10, 2025)
**PIVOT if:**
- Less than 100K QPS achieved
- p99 latency >50ms
- Data corruption issues

### After Week 4 (October 24, 2025)
**SHIP only if:**
- 500K+ QPS sustained
- <10ms p99 latency
- 3+ paying customers
- Clear differentiation

## Best Practices (Learned the Hard Way)

### DO NOT
1. Build infrastructure before proving concept
2. Claim performance without benchmarking
3. Use immature tech (Mojo) in production
4. Optimize before profiling
5. Ignore existing solutions

### DO
1. Start with POC using existing libraries
2. Measure against real competition
3. Get customer validation early
4. Be honest about limitations
5. Pivot quickly when wrong

## Immediate Actions Required

```bash
# 1. Test if learned indexes work AT ALL
python proof_of_concept.py  # Already shows failure

# 2. Test on purely sequential data
python test_sequential_learned.py  # Must be 2x faster

# 3. Compare with state-of-the-art
python benchmark_vs_dragonfly.py

# 4. Make decision by end of week
# Continue, pivot, or stop
```
