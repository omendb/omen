```

## Recommended Strategy: Unified OLTP/OLAP Database

### Why This is the Best Opportunity
**Market Size**: $22.8B ETL market by 2032 (14.8% CAGR)
**Customer Pain**: 83% want real-time analytics, 70% stuck with batch ETL
**Technical Moat**: Learned indexes for intelligent hot/cold data placement
**Competition**: Fragmented (SingleStore $1.35B valuation, TiDB $3B, new Regatta)

### Technical Architecture
```
Unified Engine:
â”œâ”€â”€ OLTP Layer: Row-oriented transactions (PostgreSQL-compatible)
â”œâ”€â”€ OLAP Layer: Columnar analytics (Arrow/Parquet)
â”œâ”€â”€ Learned Optimizer: Hot/cold placement, query routing
â”œâ”€â”€ Storage: Tiered (hot memory, warm SSD, cold object storage)
â””â”€â”€ Sync: Real-time without ETL
```

### Competitive Advantages
1. **No ETL Required**: Real-time analytics on transactional data
2. **Learned Optimization**: Intelligent data placement and query routing
3. **PostgreSQL Compatible**: Drop-in replacement for existing apps
4. **Elastic Scaling**: Separate compute for OLTP vs OLAP workloads
5. **Open Core Model**: Extensions free, managed service paid

### Alternative: Edge Analytics Database
**Market**: IoT/5G edge computing boom
**Architecture**: Embedded DB with cloud sync + learned compression
**Competition**: SQLite (no cloud sync), EdgeDB (no analytics)
**Unique Value**: "SQLite for the IoT age"

## 12-Week Development Plan

### Phase 1: Validation (Weeks 1-3)
- [ ] **Week 1**: Test learned indexes at proper scale (50M keys, 1KB values, Zipfian)
- [ ] **Week 2**: Build unified OLTP/OLAP MVP architecture
- [ ] **Week 3**: Customer interviews (target: 20 conversations, 5 LOIs)

### Phase 2: MVP (Weeks 4-8)
- [ ] **Week 4-5**: PostgreSQL-compatible OLTP layer (transactions)
- [ ] **Week 6-7**: Arrow-based OLAP layer (columnar analytics)
- [ ] **Week 8**: Real-time sync without ETL

### Phase 3: Market Entry (Weeks 9-12)

-- Real-time analytics on same data
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('hour', created_at), COUNT(*)
FROM orders
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 1;
```
