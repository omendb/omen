# Pure Algorithm Comparison: HNSW+ vs IP-DiskANN
*Ignoring existing code - which is objectively better?*

## Executive Summary

**For OmenDB's use case: IP-DiskANN wins, but it's closer than expected.**

The deciding factors are:
1. Memory efficiency (4-8x better)
2. Streaming update performance (3-4x better)
3. Disk-native design (vs memory-first)
4. Embedded database requirements

## Detailed Comparison

### Performance Characteristics

| Metric | HNSW+ | IP-DiskANN | Winner |
|--------|-------|------------|--------|
| **Update throughput** | 50-100K/sec | 200-400K/sec | IP-DiskANN (4x) |
| **Query throughput** | 100K QPS @ 0.5ms | 50K QPS @ 1ms | HNSW+ (2x) |
| **Memory/vector** | 1-2 bytes | 0.25 bytes | IP-DiskANN (4-8x) |
| **Deletion** | Tombstones/rebuild | In-place/clean | IP-DiskANN |
| **Cold start** | Fast (hierarchical) | Slower (flat) | HNSW+ |
| **Recall stability** | Degrades with deletes | Stable | IP-DiskANN |

### Architectural Differences

#### HNSW+ Hierarchical Structure
```
Layer 2: [A]         (1 node - entry point)
Layer 1: [A]--[B]--[C]  (3 nodes)
Layer 0: [A]-[B]-[C]-[D]-[E]-[F]-[G]  (all nodes)

Pros: Natural "zoom in" search, fast entry
Cons: Complex maintenance, memory overhead
```

#### IP-DiskANN Flat Structure
```
[A]⟷[B]⟷[C]
 ↕   ↕   ↕
[D]⟷[E]⟷[F]
(bidirectional edges for deletion)

Pros: Simple, memory efficient, clean deletes
Cons: Need good entry point selection
```

### Use Case Analysis

#### Scenario 1: Read-Heavy Workload (90% queries, 10% updates)
**Winner: HNSW+**
- 100K QPS vs 50K QPS matters more
- Hierarchical search is faster for pure queries
- Update performance less critical

#### Scenario 2: Write-Heavy Workload (30% queries, 70% updates)
**Winner: IP-DiskANN** 
- 400K updates/sec is game-changing
- In-place deletion prevents degradation
- Query performance still adequate

#### Scenario 3: Embedded Database (OmenDB's target)
**Winner: IP-DiskANN**
- Memory efficiency crucial (0.25 vs 2 bytes)
- Disk-native design better for persistence
- Simpler to maintain in constrained environment

#### Scenario 4: Cloud Service (Pinecone-like)
**Winner: HNSW+**
- Can throw memory at the problem
- Query latency more important than memory
- Mature, battle-tested

### Risk Assessment

#### IP-DiskANN Risks
1. **New algorithm** (Feb 2025 paper)
   - Unknown edge cases
   - Limited production data
   - Few reference implementations

2. **Microsoft-only adoption**
   - Only Azure Cosmos DB uses it
   - Could be abandoned
   - Patent concerns?

3. **Lower query throughput**
   - 50K vs 100K QPS
   - May not matter for embedded use
   - Could be optimized

#### HNSW+ Risks
1. **Memory overhead**
   - 4-8x more memory
   - Problem for embedded/edge
   - Costs add up at scale

2. **Deletion degradation**
   - Tombstones accumulate
   - Periodic rebuilds needed
   - Not truly streaming

3. **Complexity**
   - Hierarchical structure harder to optimize
   - More parameters to tune
   - Harder to debug

### The Fundamental Trade-off

```python
def choose_algorithm(use_case):
    if use_case.is_read_heavy and use_case.has_unlimited_memory:
        return "HNSW+"  # PostgreSQL, MongoDB chose this
    
    elif use_case.needs_streaming_updates and use_case.is_memory_constrained:
        return "IP-DiskANN"  # Azure Cosmos DB chose this
    
    elif use_case.is_embedded_database:
        # This is OmenDB
        if use_case.update_rate > 100K_per_sec:
            return "IP-DiskANN"  # Clear winner
        elif use_case.query_latency < 1ms:
            return "HNSW+"  # Maybe better
        else:
            return "IP-DiskANN"  # Memory efficiency wins
```

### Production Evidence

#### Who Uses HNSW (and why)
- **PostgreSQL/pgvector**: SQL integration, read-heavy
- **MongoDB**: Document DB, queries matter most
- **Redis**: In-memory, doesn't care about disk
- **Elasticsearch**: Search-first, updates secondary

#### Who Uses DiskANN variants (and why)
- **Azure Cosmos DB**: Multi-model, needs updates
- **Microsoft SQL Server 2025**: Streaming scenarios
- **Bing**: Massive scale, memory costs matter

### My Verdict

**For a greenfield implementation targeting OmenDB's use case, I'd choose IP-DiskANN.**

Here's why:

1. **Memory Efficiency is Paramount**
   - Embedded databases must be frugal
   - 0.25 bytes vs 2 bytes is 8x difference
   - Enables larger indexes on same hardware

2. **Streaming Updates are the Future**
   - Real-time AI applications need continuous updates
   - 400K updates/sec vs 100K is transformative
   - Clean deletion without degradation

3. **Simplicity Wins Long-term**
   - Flat graph easier to reason about
   - Fewer parameters to tune
   - Easier to optimize and maintain

4. **Disk-Native Design**
   - Built for SSD/NVMe from ground up
   - Not retrofitted memory algorithm
   - Better for persistent embedded DB

5. **First-Mover Advantage**
   - Being first with IP-DiskANN in OSS
   - Differentiation from HNSW crowd
   - Potential to influence standard

### The Counter-Argument for HNSW+

If I had to argue for HNSW+:

1. **Production Proven**
   - 8+ years of battle testing
   - Known failure modes
   - Extensive documentation

2. **Query Performance**
   - 2x faster queries (100K vs 50K QPS)
   - Sub-millisecond latency achievable
   - Better for read-heavy apps

3. **Ecosystem**
   - More tools and libraries
   - Easier to hire engineers who know it
   - Better community support

4. **Flexibility**
   - Hierarchical structure has benefits
   - Can tune layer distribution
   - Works well at all scales

### Final Recommendation

**Choose IP-DiskANN for OmenDB because:**

1. You're building an embedded database where memory matters
2. You need true streaming updates for real-time AI
3. You want to differentiate from the HNSW crowd
4. You can afford the risk of newer technology

**The only scenario where I'd choose HNSW+ instead:**

If OmenDB pivoted to being a read-heavy, cloud-native service where:
- Query latency < 0.5ms is critical
- Memory is unlimited
- Updates are batch-oriented
- You need proven reliability today

But for "DuckDB for vectors" with streaming updates? IP-DiskANN is the clear winner even starting from scratch.
