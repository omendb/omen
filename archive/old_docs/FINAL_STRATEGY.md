# OmenDB Final Strategy: Pure Rust, Ship Fast, Win

## The Clear Decision

**We're building OmenDB in pure Rust. Period.**

No Mojo integration for at least 12 months. No complex FFI. No three-language stack. Just clean, fast, production-grade Rust.

## Why This Makes Sense

### 1. Rust is More Than Sufficient
- We've already achieved 1.4x speedup
- Can reach 5-10x with SIMD and optimizations
- TiKV, SurrealDB, Qdrant prove Rust works for databases

### 2. Mojo Isn't Ready
- Version 0.25.6 (not even 1.0)
- No production deployments
- Missing critical database features
- MLIR/GPU execution still experimental

### 3. Complexity Kills Velocity
- Three languages = 3x slower development
- FFI debugging is a nightmare
- Build system complexity
- Team needs expertise in all three

### 4. Focus Wins
- Ship product, get users
- Optimize based on real workloads
- Build the business
- Technology can come later

## The Pragmatic Path

### October 2025: MVP
- Pure Rust database
- PyO3 Python bindings
- 2-3x PostgreSQL performance
- Deploy to omendb.com

### November 2025: Optimize
- Rust SIMD with packed_simd2
- Parallel processing with Rayon
- Cache optimizations
- 5-10x PostgreSQL performance

### December 2025: Production
- First customers
- Enterprise features
- Cloud deployment
- Revenue generation

### 2026: Scale
- 100+ customers
- Distributed architecture
- $1M ARR target
- Series A fundraising

### Q4 2026: Technology Review
**Only then consider:**
- Has Mojo reached 1.0?
- Are there production deployments?
- Do we have specific bottlenecks?
- Can we afford dual-stack maintenance?

## The Modular Insurance Policy

We've built modular architecture with traits:
```rust
trait IndexEngine { ... }
trait StorageEngine { ... }
trait ComputeEngine { ... }
```

If Mojo proves valuable in 2027, we can:
1. Implement `MojoComputeEngine`
2. A/B test against `RustSIMDEngine`
3. Adopt only if significant win
4. No architecture rewrite needed

## What About GPU/MAX?

- **Inference workloads only** (vector similarity)
- **Not core database operations**
- **Evaluate when we have GPU-specific needs**
- **CPU is sufficient for database workloads**

## Success Metrics

### What Matters
- ✅ Shipping in Q4 2025
- ✅ 100 beta users
- ✅ 3 production pilots
- ✅ Real performance gains (5x)

### What Doesn't
- ❌ Theoretical 20x with unproven tech
- ❌ Using the latest language
- ❌ GPU acceleration for CPU workloads
- ❌ Premature optimization

## The Bottom Line

1. **Rust gives us everything we need**
2. **Modular design keeps options open**
3. **Ship fast with proven technology**
4. **Re-evaluate new tech when mature**

We're not saying "never" to Mojo. We're saying "not now."

First, we build a great database. Then, we build a great business. Technology experiments come after product-market fit.

**Decision Date**: September 26, 2025
**Review Date**: Q4 2026
**Focus**: Ship, optimize, sell

*Let's build a database that works, not chase theoretical performance with immature technology.*
