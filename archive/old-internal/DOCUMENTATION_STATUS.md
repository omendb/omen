- Added proper status badges and warnings

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas Needing Attention

### Server Documentation
- `omendb/server/docs/internal/` contains ~30 design docs that may be outdated
- Need to review if server code is still aligned with engine

### Web Content
- Marketing copy needs updating to reflect actual capabilities
- Remove claims about features not yet implemented

### Internal Strategy Docs
- `internal/private/business/` contains multiple investor overview versions
- `internal/technical/` has specs that may be outdated

## üìã Documentation Guidelines

### Keep Current
- Test counts and passing rates
- Known issues and bottlenecks
- Development commands and workflows

### Avoid
- Future dates and unrealistic timelines
- Feature claims for unimplemented functionality
- Duplicate investigation/debugging docs

### Best Practices
1. Archive old investigations rather than deleting
2. Update status indicators when tests change
3. Note when components may be outdated
4. Keep README files focused on current state

## Next Steps

1. Review and consolidate server internal docs
2. Update web marketing content to match reality
3. Clean up duplicate business/investor docs
4. Add performance benchmark results when available
