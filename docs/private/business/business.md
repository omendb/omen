# OmenDB Business Strategy

**Last Updated**: December 2024  
**Philosophy**: "DuckDB for Vectors" - Enterprise-grade embedded database

## ðŸŽ¯ **Core Strategy**

**Build the best embedded vector database using state-of-art algorithms**

### Key Differentiators
- **DiskANN Algorithm**: Microsoft's Vamana - O(log n) updates, no rebuilds ever
- **Instant Startup**: 0.001ms initialization (100-1000x faster than competitors)
- **Enterprise Storage**: WAL + memory-mapped segments for production reliability
- **No Performance Cliffs**: Unlike HNSW, maintains speed at any scale
- **Embedded Excellence**: Like DuckDB - sophisticated while embedded
- **Target Performance**: 50K+ vec/s @128D with DiskANN
- **Production-Ready**: Enterprise-grade persistence, not simple snapshots

## ðŸ“Š **Market & Revenue Phases**

### **Phase 1: Embedded Database Launch (Current - v0.1.2)**
**Target**: Establish technical leadership in embedded vector databases

**Market**: 
- ML engineers building local/edge applications
- Developer tools companies needing embedded vector storage  
- IoT and edge AI applications
- Development teams prototyping vector applications

**Revenue Model**: Open Source (Free Forever)
- **Embedded Database**: FREE, unlimited vectors, full performance
- Focus on adoption, community building
- No artificial limits on embedded version
- Build reputation through technical excellence

**Success Metrics**:
- 10K+ GitHub stars within 6 months
- 1M+ pip downloads within 1 year
- Technical benchmarks beating ChromaDB/Faiss/LanceDB

### **Phase 2: Server Mode & Monetization (Future - v0.2.0+)**
**Target**: Cloud deployment with commercial tiers

**Revenue Model**: Server-Based Pricing (NOT YET AVAILABLE)
- **Free Tier**: 100K vectors (server resources limited)
  
- **Pro**: $499/month (was $199 - underpriced)
  - Unlimited vectors on server
  - Production monitoring
  - Priority support
  - 99.9% SLA
  
- **Enterprise**: $2,999/month (was $999 - underpriced)
  - Multi-tenant isolation
  - Custom deployment options
  - Security features (encryption, RBAC)
  - Dedicated support
  - Custom features

**Revenue Target**: $500K ARR from 50 Pro + 15 Enterprise customers

### **Phase 3: Server Mode (Year 2)**
**Target**: Distributed deployment and managed services

**Revenue Model**: Self-Hosted + Managed
- **Server License**: $2,999/year per cluster
- **Managed Service**: $299-999/month per cluster

**Revenue Target**: $500K Annual Revenue Run Rate

### **Phase 4: PaaS Platform (Year 3+)**
**Target**: Full SaaS platform competing with Pinecone

**Revenue Model**: Usage-Based SaaS
- **Starter**: $29/month (100K vectors)
- **Growth**: $199/month (1M vectors)
- **Scale**: $999/month (10M vectors)

**Revenue Target**: $2M+ Annual Revenue Run Rate

## ðŸš€ **Current Focus (v0.3.0)**

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Fix DiskANN batch bug** - Resolve 1K/9K processing limitation
2. **Scale testing** - Validate 50K+ vec/s at 100K+ vectors
3. **WAL + mmap storage** - Implement enterprise-grade persistence  
4. **Remove HNSW code** - Simplify to DiskANN-only architecture

### Success Definition
- DiskANN performing at 50K+ vec/s consistently
- Production-ready persistence with <5% overhead
- Clean, maintainable single-algorithm codebase
- Ready for v0.3.0 release

## ðŸ’° **Competitive Positioning**

**vs ChromaDB**: 10x faster inserts, no rebuilds ever, embedded excellence
**vs Pinecone**: Embedded option, instant startup, no cloud dependency
**vs Weaviate**: Better algorithm (DiskANN vs HNSW), simpler deployment
**vs Qdrant**: Microsoft's proven algorithm, embedded-first design

**Moat**: DiskANN's O(log n) updates + instant startup + enterprise embedded

---

**Next Phase Trigger**: 1000+ GitHub stars OR 50+ production users OR competitive benchmark leadership
