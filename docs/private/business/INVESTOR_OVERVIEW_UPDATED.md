# OmenDB: Vector Database Platform (Pre-Seed)

**Executive Summary for Early-Stage Funding Discussions**

## üöÄ The Opportunity

### Market Size & Growth
- **Vector Database Market**: $1.5B (2024) ‚Üí $11.5B (2030) @ 40.5% CAGR
- **Key Drivers**: LLM adoption, RAG applications, similarity search
- **Target Segments**: AI startups, enterprises modernizing search, ML teams

### The Problem We Solve
1. **Limited Scalability**: Most solutions either embedded-only or cloud-only
2. **Complex Infrastructure**: Difficult setup and management
3. **High Costs**: Pinecone charges $70-2000/month for basic usage
4. **Poor Performance**: Trade-offs between speed, cost, and ease

### Our Vision: OmenDB
- **"Embedded to Cloud"**: Single engine scales from mobile to datacenter
- **DiskANN Algorithm**: Microsoft's proven approach for disk-resident vectors
- **Mojo Performance**: SIMD operations faster than Go/Python alternatives
- **Open Source Core**: Community-driven development like Redis/Elastic

## üõ†Ô∏è Current Status (Honest Assessment)

### What We Have
- **Core Algorithms**: Vamana graph construction working correctly
- **Basic Operations**: Add/search functional at small scale
- **Python Integration**: Seamless via Mojo's interop
- **Team**: Founder + AI-assisted development

### What We're Building (3-6 months)
- **PQ Compression**: 10x memory reduction (in progress)
- **Disk Persistence**: True disk-native storage
- **Scale Testing**: 100K ‚Üí 1M ‚Üí 10M vectors
- **Rust Server**: Production infrastructure

### Timeline to MVP
- **Month 1**: Fix core engine issues (PQ, persistence)
- **Month 2**: Build server infrastructure
- **Month 3**: Launch beta with 10 design partners
- **Month 4-6**: Iterate based on feedback

## üí∞ Business Model

### Open Source + Cloud (Proven Model)

**Core Engine** (Free, Open Source)
- Mojo vector database engine
- Python/C bindings
- Self-hosted deployment
- Community support

**Cloud Platform** (SaaS Revenue)
- Managed hosting ($99-999/mo)
- Auto-scaling
- Enterprise features
- SLA guarantees

**Enterprise** (High-Value Contracts)
- On-premise deployment
- Custom integrations
- Professional services
- Priority support

### Revenue Projections (Conservative)
- **Year 1**: $100K ARR (10 customers @ $10K)
- **Year 2**: $1M ARR (50 customers @ $20K)
- **Year 3**: $5M ARR (200 customers @ $25K)

## üéØ Competitive Advantage

### Why We Can Win
1. **Unique Positioning**: Only solution that scales embedded ‚Üí cloud
2. **Technical Innovation**: Mojo's SIMD performance + DiskANN efficiency
3. **Developer-First**: Open source core with great DX
4. **Timing**: Early in the vector DB market evolution

### Competitive Landscape
