# Quick Performance Review - October 28, 2025

**Context**: Pre-benchmark sanity check for obvious performance issues

---

## Hot Path Analysis

### 1. Query Path (CRITICAL - Most Important)

**File**: `src/vector/store.rs::knn_search()`

✅ **Clean**:
- No clones in hot path
- Direct HNSW search: `index.search(&query.data, k)`
- Returns Vec<(usize, f32)> - minimal allocation

**Brute-force fallback** (line 197-224):
- Only used for small datasets (<100 vectors)
- Has one collect() but acceptable for fallback

**Verdict**: Query path is optimal ✅

---

### 2. Batch Insert Path (Build Time)

**File**: `src/vector/store.rs::batch_insert()` (line 71-130)

⚠️ **One clone per chunk**:
```rust
let vector_data: Vec<Vec<f32>> = chunk
    .iter()
    .map(|v| v.data.clone())  // ← CLONE HERE
    .collect();
```

**Analysis**:
- Clones 10K vectors × 1536 dims × 4 bytes = 61 MB per chunk
- Called 100 times for 1M vectors = 6.1 GB total clones
- **BUT**: Happens once at build time, not in query path
- **Constraint**: hnsw_rs API requires `&[Vec<f32>]`, can't avoid

**Optimization Options**:
1. ❌ Change Vector to Arc<Vec<f32>> - adds overhead everywhere
2. ❌ Reuse buffer - complex, marginal benefit
3. ✅ Accept as necessary - build is one-time cost

**Current build rate**: 423 vec/sec (Mac M3)
- 1M vectors = ~40 minutes
- Clone overhead: ~5-10% of build time (estimate)
- HNSW insertion dominates (graph construction is O(log n) per insert)

**Verdict**: Clone is acceptable, focus on HNSW params instead ⚠️

---

### 3. Save/Load Path

**File**: `src/vector/store.rs::save_to_disk()` (line 275-314)

⚠️ **One clone for vectors.bin**:
```rust
let vectors_data: Vec<Vec<f32>> = self.vectors
    .iter()
    .map(|v| v.data.clone())
    .collect();
```

**Analysis**:
- Happens once per save (not frequent)
- 1M vectors × 1536 dims × 4 bytes = 6.1 GB clone
- Necessary for bincode serialization
- Save time: ~4-5 seconds for 1M vectors (measured)

**Verdict**: Acceptable for infrequent operation ✅

---

## Potential Optimizations (Future)

### Low-Hanging Fruit

1. **HNSW Parameters** (Week 9-10):
   - Current: M=48, ef_construction=200
   - Could tune for build speed vs recall tradeoff
   - Research optimal params for 1536D vectors

2. **SIMD Distance** (Optional):
   - Current: Scalar f32 operations
   - hnsw_rs has SIMD support: `features = ["simdeez_f"]`
   - Would speed up distance calculations ~2-4x
   - **Note**: Query time already <15ms, may not matter

3. **Parallel Loading** (Future):
   - Currently: Serial load from disk
   - Could parallelize vector deserialization
   - Benefit: 2-3x faster load (6s → 2-3s)

### Not Worth It (Now)

1. ❌ Remove clones in batch_insert - can't without API change
2. ❌ Custom allocator - premature optimization
3. ❌ Unsafe code - unnecessary, current perf acceptable

---

## Profiling Plan

**Next Steps**:
1. ✅ Wait for 1M validation to complete (~15 min remaining)
2. ✅ Run flamegraph on query workload
3. ✅ Identify actual bottlenecks (vs guessing)
4. ✅ Document findings

**Expected Findings**:
- 90%+ time in HNSW search (not our code)
- Distance calculations: 5-10%
- Allocations: <1%

**If profiling shows otherwise**: Investigate and optimize

---

## Conclusion

**Current code is production-ready** for benchmarking:
- ✅ No obvious performance bugs
- ✅ Hot paths are clean
- ✅ Clones are necessary and acceptable
- ⚠️ Future optimizations available but not critical

**Recommendation**: Proceed with pgvector benchmarks as-is, optimize later based on:
1. Profiling data (identify real bottlenecks)
2. Benchmark results (where do we fall short?)
3. User feedback (what matters in practice?)

**Premature optimization avoided** ✅
