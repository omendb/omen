## Value Proposition by Use Case

### IoT/Sensor Data
> "Handle 4.7x more sensor data per second than SQLite, without distributed database complexity. Perfect for edge gateways processing 100K+ events/sec."

**Why OmenDB**:
- Random UUID timestamps → perfect for batch_insert optimization
- Write-heavy (90%+ writes) → leverages our strength
- Edge deployment → single-node simplicity matters

**Proof Points**:
- 944K inserts/sec vs 201K/sec (SQLite) at 10M scale
- No O(n) rebuild spikes (gapped arrays)
- Production-ready (WAL, crash recovery)

### Analytics Data Collection
> "Ingest events 4.7x faster than SQLite while keeping data queryable for real-time analytics. No separate OLTP/OLAP databases needed."

**Why OmenDB**:
- Bulk event ingestion → batch_insert shines
- Unified HTAP → no ETL to analytics DB
- Columnar storage → efficient analytics queries

**Proof Points**:
- 4.71x faster random inserts (event UUIDs)
- Arrow/Parquet columnar storage
- DataFusion SQL analytics

### ETL Pipelines
> "Cut bulk data import time by 75% with OmenDB's optimized batch insert. Load 10M rows in 10.6 seconds vs 50.2 seconds with SQLite."

**Why OmenDB**:
- Batch import = our core strength
- Pre-sorting optimization automatic
- Handles random/unordered data well

**Proof Points**:
- 10M random inserts: 10.6s vs 50.2s (SQLite)
- Linear scaling (10x data = 10x time)
- No rebuild pauses during import

## Outreach Strategy

### Phase 1: Warm Introductions (Week 1-2)

**Target**: 10 warm intros from network

**Channels**:
1. **YC Founders**: Reach out to YC batch mates with relevant use cases
2. **GitHub Stars**: Contact developers who starred learned index repos
3. **Tech Twitter**: DM founders/CTOs tweeting about database performance
4. **HN Readers**: Engage on HN posts about SQLite alternatives

**Pitch Template** (Cold Email):
```
Subject: 4.7x faster SQLite for [THEIR USE CASE]

Hi [Name],

I saw [THEIR COMPANY] is using SQLite for [THEIR USE CASE]. We built OmenDB -
a drop-in replacement that's 2-3x faster overall, with 4.7x faster inserts
for write-heavy workloads.

Validated at 10M rows against SQLite. Perfect for [THEIR SPECIFIC PAIN].

Would you be open to a quick call to see if this solves a real pain point
for you? Happy to run benchmarks on your exact workload.

[Your name]
OmenDB - https://github.com/yourusername/omendb
```

### Phase 2: Target Companies (Week 2-4)

**High-Priority Targets** (companies with known write-heavy DB needs):

**IoT/Sensor**:
- Particle (IoT platform)
- Samsara (fleet tracking)
- Blues Wireless (edge IoT)

**Analytics**:
- PostHog (product analytics)
- Plausible (web analytics)
- Umami (lightweight analytics)

**Time-Series**:
- QuestDB (time-series DB - potential partner/competitor)
- InfluxData (monitoring - could use embedded component)
- Grafana Labs (metrics - edge aggregation use case)

**ETL/Data**:
- Airbyte (data integration)
- Fivetran (ETL platform)
- dbt Labs (data transformation)

### Phase 3: Community Engagement (Ongoing)

**Content Strategy**:
1. **HN Launch**: "Show HN: OmenDB - 4.7x faster inserts than SQLite with learned indexes"
2. **Blog Post**: "How we achieved 4.7x faster inserts than SQLite (auto-retrain optimization)"
3. **Benchmarks**: Public reproducible benchmarks vs SQLite/DuckDB
4. **Case Studies**: Early customer stories (once we have them)

**Open Source**:
- Make repo public (already on GitHub)
- Add CONTRIBUTING.md
- Create GitHub Discussions for Q&A
- Respond to issues within 24h

## Qualification Criteria

**Must Have**:
- Write-heavy workload (>50% writes) OR high-volume bulk imports
- Currently using SQLite/embedded database (easy migration)
- Experiencing performance issues (measurable pain)

**Nice to Have**:
- Willingness to test early-stage tech
- Technical team that can run benchmarks
- Budget for commercial licensing (seed validation)

**Disqualifiers**:
- Read-heavy workload (<20% writes) - not our strength
- Already using distributed DB (CockroachDB, TiDB) - different segment
- Sub-10K row datasets - SQLite is fine

## FAQ / Objections Handling

**Q: "Why not just use PostgreSQL?"**
A: PostgreSQL is client-server, OmenDB is embedded (like SQLite). Use case: edge devices, mobile apps, single-node deployments where you don't want to run a separate server.

**Q: "Is this production-ready?"**
A: 325 tests passing, WAL durability, crash recovery. Validated at 10M scale. Early-stage (pre-seed) but solid foundation. Looking for design partners to harden for production.

**Q: "What if our workload is read-heavy?"**
A: OmenDB is optimized for write-heavy workloads. For read-heavy, stick with SQLite or use DuckDB. We're honest about our strengths.

**Q: "How do we migrate from SQLite?"**
A: Working on migration tools. Currently: export SQLite to CSV, bulk import to OmenDB. SQL compatibility is on roadmap (PostgreSQL wire protocol).

**Q: "What's the catch?"**
A: We're pre-seed, so you'd be an early adopter. Benefit: shape the product, get support, potential pricing discount. Risk: not as battle-tested as SQLite (yet).

**Q: "Can you benchmark our exact workload?"**
A: Yes! Send us your workload characteristics (schema, data distribution, read/write ratio) and we'll run custom benchmarks.
