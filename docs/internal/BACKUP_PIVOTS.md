# Backup Pivot Ideas

**Created**: September 25, 2025
**Current Focus**: Learned Database Systems
**If current pivot fails by Oct 7**: Consider these alternatives

## 1. Multimodal Database (Strongest Alternative)

**Concept**: Database that natively handles text, images, audio, video, code with unified queries
- **Zero competition**: No existing multimodal databases (everyone treats multimedia as blobs)
- **Market timing**: Perfect timing with multimodal AI explosion
- **Technical foundation**: Vector + relational + blob unified storage
- **Previous work**: zendb was our early Rust experiment in this direction

**Real-world example**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    id SERIAL,
    name TEXT,
    description TEXT,
    product_image BYTEA,
    category_embedding VECTOR(512)
);

SELECT * FROM products
WHERE description SIMILAR TO 'red shoes'
  AND product_image SIMILAR TO @query_image  -- Visual similarity
  AND price < 100
ORDER BY image_similarity(product_image, @query_image) DESC;
```

**Go-to-market**: PostgreSQL extension for native multimodal queries
**Validation**: Can we build image similarity search in 1 week?

## 2. Inference Database

**Concept**: Database where every query can invoke ML models natively
- **Built-in model serving**: No separate inference servers
- **Result caching**: Smart caching of expensive ML operations
- **Model versioning**: A/B test models in production
- **GPU acceleration**: Native CUDA/Metal support

**Real-world example**:
```sql
SELECT
    customer_id,
    review_text,
    classify_sentiment(review_text) as sentiment,        -- Built-in ML
    extract_entities(review_text) as entities,          -- NER model
    generate_summary(review_text, max_length=50) as summary
FROM reviews
WHERE embed_similarity(review_text, 'customer service issues') > 0.8;
```

**Competition**: Nobody does this natively (everyone uses separate services)
**Validation**: Can we integrate a model server with PostgreSQL?

## 3. Max-Optimized Vector Database

**Technical approach**: Python + Max Engine (not Mojo)
- **Max Engine advantages**: 10-100x faster inference than TensorFlow/PyTorch
- **Python bindings**: Use Max's Python API for embedding generation + similarity
- **Unique access**: First-mover advantage with Max capabilities
- **Target**: Enterprise customers needing extreme performance

**Challenge**: Max Engine still early, limited availability
**Advantage**: No one else has Max access yet
**Validation**: Can we get Max Engine access and show 10x speedup?

## 4. Time Series + Vector Hybrid

**Market gap analysis**:
- **InfluxDB**: Time series, no vectors
- **TimescaleDB**: Time series PostgreSQL, basic vector support
- **QuestDB**: Fast time series, no vectors
- **Opportunity**: IoT sensor data + semantic search

**Real-world example**:
```sql
-- IoT monitoring with semantic alerts
SELECT * FROM sensor_data
WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
  AND embed_similarity(alert_description, 'temperature anomaly') > 0.8
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;

-- Financial data + ML predictions
SELECT stock_symbol, price, timestamp,
       predict_next_price(price_history) as predicted_price
FROM stock_prices
WHERE embed_similarity(news_sentiment, 'market volatility') > 0.7;
```

**B2B potential**: IoT companies, financial firms, log analysis
**Validation**: Do we know any IoT companies with this exact pain?

## 5. Edge Database System

**Current landscape gaps**:
- **SQLite**: Not optimized for edge constraints
- **Realm**: Mobile-focused, not true edge
- **PouchDB**: Web-focused, not embedded

**Missing features**:
- < 1MB footprint (SQLite is ~600KB)
- Offline-first with intelligent sync
- Cross-platform (ARM, x86, RISC-V)
- Ultra-low power consumption
- Built for IoT/embedded constraints

**Market**: Massive IoT market, everyone currently hacks SQLite
**Challenge**: Lower margins than B2B database solutions
**Validation**: Can we beat SQLite on size/performance benchmarks?

## Decision Framework

**Priority ranking based on opportunity + technical feasibility:**

1. **Multimodal Database** - Zero competition + perfect timing (AI multimodal explosion)
2. **Inference Database** - Unique concept + high enterprise value
3. **Time Series + Vector** - Clear market gap + strong B2B sales potential
4. **Edge Database** - Huge IoT market but lower margins
5. **Max Vector Database** - High performance but depends on Max Engine adoption

**Evaluation criteria for any pivot**:
- Can we build a convincing demo in 1 week?
- Is there zero or minimal direct competition?
- Does it leverage our database + systems expertise?
- Is the market timing favorable?
- Can we realistically achieve product-market fit by YC deadline?

**Quick validation tests**:
- **Multimodal**: Build image similarity search with PostgreSQL extension
- **Inference**: Integrate Hugging Face model with database queries
- **Time+Vector**: Find 3 IoT companies with this exact problem
- **Edge**: Beat SQLite on size + performance benchmarks
- **Max Vector**: Get Max Engine access and demonstrate speedup

## Research Preserved

Key research papers and competitive analyses are in:
- `external/papers/` - Core research
- `internal/BUSINESS.md` - Market analysis
- Git history - All previous strategic thinking

## Quick Access Commands

```bash
# If we need to pivot:
git log --oneline | grep -i "vector\|multimodal\|pivot"  # Find old work
find . -name "*.md" | xargs grep -l "multimodal\|inference"  # Find relevant docs
```

**Remember**: The learned database pivot is strong (7.89x achieved on Day 1). Only use these backups if we can't reach 10x by Oct 7.
