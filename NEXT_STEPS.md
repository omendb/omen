# Next Steps for OmenDB

## Current Situation (September 26, 2025)

### What We Know
1. **Learned indexes don't work** - 8-14x slower than B-trees
2. **Core thesis disproven** - No performance advantage
3. **5% complete** - Mostly documentation, little working code
4. **Competition solved it** - DragonflyDB (3.8M QPS), DuckDB (analytics)

### Assets We Have
1. **Mojo HNSW code** (in separate repo, 867 vec/s)
2. **PostgreSQL extension** (toy implementation)
3. **PyO3 bindings** (reusable foundation)
4. **Hard-won knowledge** (what doesn't work)

## Recommended Path: Vector Search Pivot

### Why Vector Search Makes Sense
1. **Growing market** - AI/ML applications need vector DBs
2. **Clear benchmarks** - Qdrant, Pinecone set the bar
3. **We have code** - HNSW implementation exists
4. **Achievable target** - 20K vec/s with optimization

### Week 1 Tasks (by Oct 3)
```bash
# 1. Locate and test HNSW code
cd /path/to/mojo/hnsw
pixi run python benchmarks/final_validation.py

# 2. Benchmark against competition
pip install qdrant-client pinecone-client weaviate-client
python benchmark_vector_dbs.py

# 3. Fix bulk construction (critical issue)
# Currently creates disconnected graphs

# 4. Customer validation
# Contact 3 potential users for vector DB needs
```

### Alternative: DuckDB Extension

If vector search doesn't pan out:

```sql
-- Build specialized extension for DuckDB
CREATE EXTENSION learned_index;

-- Add to specific use case (time-series)
CREATE TABLE metrics AS
SELECT * FROM read_parquet('metrics.parquet')
WITH (index_type = 'learned');

-- Leverage DuckDB's optimization
```

### Shutdown Checklist (if needed)

If neither path is viable:

1. **Open source findings**
   - Publish FINAL_VERDICT.md
   - Share benchmark code
   - Document lessons learned

2. **Archive repositories**
   - Make pg-learned read-only
   - Archive website
   - Preserve documentation

3. **Write post-mortem**
   - What we tried
   - Why it failed
   - What others can learn

## Decision Framework

### Continue IF:
- Vector search shows >10x improvement potential
- 3+ customers validate need
- Clear path to 20K vec/s
- Can achieve MVP in 8 weeks

### Pivot IF:
- Vector search <5x improvement
- DuckDB extension shows promise
- Different use case emerges
- Customer pulls in new direction

### Stop IF:
- No viable performance advantage
- No customer interest
- Better opportunities elsewhere
- Oct 3 passes without clarity

## Immediate Actions (Next 24 Hours)

1. **Find Mojo HNSW code**
```bash
find ~/github -name "*.mojo" | grep -i hnsw
```

2. **Test vector performance**
```bash
python test_vector_search.py
```

3. **Call potential customers**
- "Would 10x faster vector search change your architecture?"
- "What's your current pain with Qdrant/Pinecone?"
- "Would you pay for this?"

4. **Update stakeholders**
- Send FINAL_VERDICT.md
- Set Oct 3 decision meeting
- Prepare for pivot or shutdown

## The Bottom Line

**Learned indexes for key-value stores don't work.** This is proven.

**Vector search might work.** This needs validation by Oct 3.

**Don't continue without validation.** The market doesn't need another failed database.

Make the decision based on data, not hope.
