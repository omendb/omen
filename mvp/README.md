# PostgreSQL Real-Time Analytics MVP
## For YC S26 Application (6-Week Sprint)

## Product: pgAnalytics
**Tagline**: "Turn any PostgreSQL into a real-time analytics database"

## Value Proposition
- **Problem**: Companies need real-time analytics but PostgreSQL is slow for OLAP
- **Solution**: Automatic columnar replica with 100x faster analytics
- **Market**: 40M+ PostgreSQL instances worldwide
- **Price**: $99/month per database

## Technical Stack (Proven & Fast)
```python
Core:
  - Python 3.11 + FastAPI (rapid development)
  - DuckDB 0.10 (embedded OLAP, no dependencies)
  - PostgreSQL logical replication (standard CDC)
  - Docker deployment (one-click install)

Why this stack:
  - DuckDB: 100x faster than PostgreSQL for analytics
  - Logical replication: Built into PostgreSQL, zero overhead
  - Python: Fast enough, huge ecosystem
  - FastAPI: Modern, async, great docs
```

## MVP Features (6 Weeks)
- ✅ One-click PostgreSQL connection
- ✅ Automatic schema replication
- ✅ Real-time data sync (<1 second lag)
- ✅ SQL query interface
- ✅ 100x faster aggregations
- ✅ Basic monitoring dashboard

## Development Timeline

### Week 1 (Sept 27 - Oct 3)
- [ ] PostgreSQL CDC connector with wal2json
- [ ] DuckDB integration and schema mapping
- [ ] Basic data sync working

### Week 2 (Oct 4 - Oct 10)
- [ ] Automatic schema replication
- [ ] Incremental updates (not full reload)
- [ ] Query routing (OLTP vs OLAP)

### Week 3 (Oct 11 - Oct 17)
- [ ] FastAPI REST interface
- [ ] SQL query execution
- [ ] Performance monitoring

### Week 4 (Oct 18 - Oct 24)
- [ ] Customer discovery (10 interviews)
- [ ] Get 3 pilot customers
- [ ] Fix critical issues

### Week 5 (Oct 25 - Oct 31)
- [ ] Polish UI/UX
- [ ] Create demo video
- [ ] Deploy to production

### Week 6 (Nov 1 - Nov 7)
- [ ] YC application
- [ ] Metrics dashboard showing traction
- [ ] Customer testimonials

## Success Metrics for YC
- 3+ paying pilot customers ($297 MRR)
- 100x performance improvement demonstrated
- 10+ customer interviews validating need
- Working production deployment
- Clear expansion path to $100K MRR

## Customer Acquisition Plan
1. **PostgreSQL Slack/Discord**: Share benchmarks
2. **HackerNews**: "Show HN: 100x faster PostgreSQL analytics"
3. **Reddit r/PostgreSQL**: Technical deep-dive post
4. **Direct outreach**: 50 companies using PostgreSQL

## Demo Script for YC
```sql
-- Connect to any PostgreSQL database
pgAnalytics.connect('postgresql://...')

-- Original PostgreSQL (slow)
SELECT date_trunc('hour', created_at) as hour,
       COUNT(*), AVG(amount), SUM(amount)
FROM transactions
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY 1;
-- Time: 45 seconds

-- With pgAnalytics (fast)
SELECT date_trunc('hour', created_at) as hour,
       COUNT(*), AVG(amount), SUM(amount)
FROM analytics.transactions
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY 1;
-- Time: 0.3 seconds (150x faster!)
```

## Why This Will Get Into YC
1. **Clear value**: 100x performance is compelling
2. **Large market**: Every PostgreSQL user needs this
3. **Quick validation**: Can show working product
4. **Revenue traction**: Can get paying customers fast
5. **Technical moat**: Learned indexes for future optimization

## Revenue Model
- **Starter**: $99/month (1 database, <10GB)
- **Pro**: $299/month (3 databases, <100GB)
- **Enterprise**: $999/month (unlimited, support)

Target: 10 customers by YC interview = $1K MRR

## Technical Differentiators
- Zero-configuration setup
- No data movement required
- Real-time sync (<1 second)
- PostgreSQL native (vs proprietary protocols)
- Future: Learned index optimization

## Fallback Plans
If this doesn't work:
1. Pivot to query optimization tool
2. Pivot to database monitoring
3. Join another YC company as technical co-founder
