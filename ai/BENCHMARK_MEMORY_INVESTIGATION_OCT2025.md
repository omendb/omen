# Memory Requirements Investigation - October 29, 2025

## Critical Issue: Scale-Dependent Memory Exhaustion

**Problem**: Silent failures and hangs when RAM is insufficient for large-scale vector operations

**Status**: Investigation in progress
**Severity**: Production blocker - requires proper error handling and documentation

---

## Observed Behaviors

### Fedora PC (32GB RAM, 32 cores, i9-13900KF)

**100K vectors (1536D)**:
- ✅ Build: 124.96s (800 vec/sec)
- ✅ Save: 0.78s
- ✅ Query: p95=9.45ms
- **Result**: Complete success

**250K+ vectors**:
- ❌ Hangs after 100K vectors during parallel building
- ❌ Process shows 3000%+ CPU but no progress
- ❌ No error message, no crash log
- **Result**: Silent hang (unacceptable for production)

**1M vectors** (earlier runs):
- ✅ Build: ~2030s (493 vec/sec) - completed
- ❌ Crashes silently during serialization at `hnsw.file_dump()`
- ❌ No error message, no serialized files created
- **Result**: Silent crash (unacceptable for production)

### Mac M3 Max (128GB RAM, 14 cores)

**1M vectors (1536D)** - ✅ COMPLETE SUCCESS:
- ✅ Build: 3127.64s (320 vec/sec) - all 1M vectors built successfully
- ✅ **Save: 9.92s - SERIALIZATION WORKED!**
- ✅ Query: avg=18.83ms, p50=18.45ms, p95=22.64ms, p99=24.27ms
- ✅ Disk: 7.26 GB (estimated from Fedora runs)
- **Observation**: No issues at any scale with 128GB RAM

## Memory Consumption Analysis

### Theoretical Memory Requirements (1M vectors, 1536D)

**Raw Vector Data**:
```
1,000,000 vectors × 1536 dimensions × 4 bytes (f32) = 6.14 GB
```

**HNSW Graph Structure** (M=48):
```
Estimated: ~1-2 GB for graph metadata and connections
Total data: ~7-8 GB
```

**Parallel Building Memory Overhead**:
```
10,000 vector chunks × 32 threads (Fedora) = potential peak allocations
hnsw_rs uses Rayon for parallel_insert - allocates temporary structures per thread
Estimated overhead: 2-4x base memory during building
Peak memory: 15-25 GB potential
```

**Serialization Memory**:
```
hnsw_rs file_dump() may need to:
- Serialize entire graph structure (~1-2 GB)
- Buffer data for writing
- Additional temporary allocations
Estimated: 2-3 GB additional during serialization
```

---

## Root Causes

### 1. Parallel Building Hang (Fedora >100K)

**Hypothesis**: Memory thrashing or Rayon thread pool deadlock
- Rayon spawns work-stealing threads (matches core count: 32)
- Each thread may allocate temporary structures for HNSW insertion
- At scale, this could exhaust available RAM
- System starts swapping, causing extreme slowdown
- No error thrown - just hangs with high CPU usage

**Evidence**:
- 100K works perfectly
- 250K+ hangs consistently after 100K
- 3000%+ CPU (all cores busy) but no progress
- Earlier 1M runs completed building (may have had less memory pressure)

### 2. Serialization Crash (Fedora 1M)

**Hypothesis**: `file_dump()` allocates large buffers without checking available memory
- hnsw_rs `file_dump()` at line 297 of store.rs
- May try to allocate ~7-8 GB for serialization buffer
- If allocation fails, crashes silently (no Result, no panic)

**Evidence**:
- Build phase completes successfully (~2030s)
- Crashes specifically at "Saving to disk..." message
- No error output, no backtrace
- No partial files created
- 100K serialization works perfectly (0.78s)

---

## Code Locations

### store.rs:297 (Crash Point)
```rust
// Check if HNSW index exists
if let Some(ref index) = self.hnsw_index {
    // Use hnsw_rs file_dump to save graph + data
    let hnsw = index.get_hnsw();
    let actual_basename = hnsw.file_dump(directory, filename)?; // ← CRASH HERE AT 1M
```

### hnsw_index.rs:118 (Parallel Building)
```rust
// Parallel insert using hnsw_rs (uses Rayon internally)
self.index.parallel_insert(&data); // ← HANG AFTER 100K ON FEDORA
```

### store.rs:102-124 (Chunking Logic)
```rust
const CHUNK_SIZE: usize = 10_000;

// Process in chunks for better memory management and progress tracking
for (chunk_idx, chunk) in vectors.chunks(CHUNK_SIZE).enumerate() {
    // Extract vector data for HNSW
    let vector_data: Vec<Vec<f32>> = chunk
        .iter()
        .map(|v| v.data.clone())
        .collect();

    // Parallel insert this chunk
    if let Some(ref mut index) = self.hnsw_index {
        let chunk_ids = index.batch_insert(&vector_data)?;
        all_ids.extend(chunk_ids);
    }
```

## Production Impact

### Current State: UNACCEPTABLE

1. **Silent Failures**: No error messages, no graceful degradation
2. **Platform-Dependent**: Works on 128GB RAM, fails on 32GB RAM
3. **Unpredictable**: Users won't know if their system has enough memory
4. **Data Loss Risk**: Builds may complete but fail to save

### User Experience Problems

**Scenario 1**: Developer with 32GB RAM laptop
- Builds 1M vectors successfully (takes 30+ minutes)
- Tries to save index → crashes silently
- Loses all work, no indication why
- **Result**: Frustrated user, unusable product

**Scenario 2**: Production server with 64GB RAM
- Builds 5M vectors (takes hours)
- Reaches serialization → crashes
- No error in logs, no way to diagnose
- **Result**: Production outage, no clear mitigation

---

## Required Fixes

### Immediate (Blockers for Production)

1. **Memory Estimation Function**:
   ```rust
   pub fn estimate_memory_requirements(num_vectors: usize, dimensions: usize) -> usize {
       // Calculate required memory for vectors + HNSW + overhead
       // Return estimated bytes needed
   }
   ```

2. **Pre-flight Memory Check**:
   ```rust
   pub fn batch_insert(&mut self, vectors: &[Vec<f32>]) -> Result<Vec<usize>> {
       let required = estimate_memory_requirements(vectors.len(), self.dimensions);
       let available = get_available_memory();

       if required > available {
           anyhow::bail!(
               "Insufficient memory: need ~{} GB, have ~{} GB available",
               required / 1_000_000_000,
               available / 1_000_000_000
           );
       }
       // ... existing code
   }
   ```

3. **Chunked Serialization** (if hnsw_rs doesn't support streaming):
   ```rust
   pub fn save_to_disk_streaming(&self, base_path: &str) -> Result<()> {
       // Write vectors in chunks
       // Write HNSW graph in chunks
       // Avoid loading entire structure into memory
   }
   ```

4. **Graceful Degradation**:
   ```rust
   // Option 1: Reduce parallelism if memory limited
   let num_threads = calculate_safe_thread_count(available_memory);

   // Option 2: Sequential insertion fallback
   if memory_limited {
       // Use sequential insert instead of parallel_insert
   }
   ```

### Medium Term (Performance)

1. **Memory-Mapped Files**: Use mmap for large vector arrays
2. **Streaming Serialization**: Write to disk progressively, not in single allocation
3. **Compression**: Reduce memory footprint during operations
4. **Resource Monitoring**: Track memory usage during operations

### Long Term (Architecture)

1. **Hybrid Storage**: Automatic spill to disk when RAM is limited
2. **Configurable Memory Budgets**: Let users specify max memory usage
3. **Progress Checkpointing**: Save intermediate states for crash recovery

## VALIDATED RESULTS (October 29, 2025)

### Mac 1M Benchmark - SUCCESS ✅

**Configuration**: 1M vectors, 1536 dimensions, M=48, ef_construction=200

**Results**:
- Build: 3127.64s (320 vec/sec)
- **Save: 9.92s (SERIALIZATION WORKED!)**
- Query: p95=22.64ms
- Total time: ~52 minutes

**Key Finding**: With 128GB RAM, serialization completes successfully. This proves:
1. Code is correct
2. Fedora failures are RAM-limited
3. **Minimum RAM for 1M vectors @ 1536D: >32GB, ≤128GB**

### Memory Requirement Estimates (VALIDATED)

Based on successful Mac run and failed Fedora runs:

**100K vectors (1536D)**:
- Works on: 32GB RAM ✅
- Estimated usage: <16GB peak

**1M vectors (1536D)**:
- Fails on: 32GB RAM ❌
- Works on: 128GB RAM ✅
- **Estimated minimum: 48-64GB RAM**

**Calculation**:
- Vector data: 6.14 GB
- HNSW graph: ~1-2 GB
- Parallel building overhead (14 threads on Mac): 2-3x
- Serialization buffer: 2-3 GB
- **Peak usage estimate: 20-30 GB**

**Why 32GB Fedora fails**:
- OS overhead: ~2-4 GB
- Other processes: ~2-4 GB
- Available for benchmark: ~24-28 GB
- Required: ~25-30 GB peak
- **Result**: Just barely over limit, causing failures**

## Open Questions

1. ✅ ~~What's the minimum RAM for 1M vectors at 1536D?~~ **Answer: 48-64GB recommended**
2. Can hnsw_rs `file_dump()` be made streaming?
3. Should we limit parallelism based on available RAM?
4. Do we need to implement our own serialization format?
