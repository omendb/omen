# OmenDB Validation & Quality Plan

**Date**: October 27, 2025
**Status**: Week 6 Complete - VALIDATION PHASE (NOT Marketing Phase)
**Critical**: AI-generated database requires extensive verification before production use

---

## Core Principle: Verify Everything

This is an AI-assisted codebase. Before ANY public launch or marketing:
1. Comprehensive testing and validation
2. Code quality and security audit
3. Edge case and failure testing
4. Real-world correctness validation
5. Performance validation (not just claims)
6. Peer review by experienced engineers

**Timeline**: 4-8 weeks of rigorous validation BEFORE considering launch

---

## Phase 1: Correctness Validation (Week 7-8)

### Vector Operations Correctness

**Test Categories**:
1. **Distance Calculations**: ✅ COMPLETE (Oct 27)
   - [x] L2 distance matches reference implementations
   - [x] Cosine distance matches reference implementations
   - [x] Dot product matches reference implementations
   - [x] Edge cases: zero vectors, unit vectors, opposite vectors
   - [x] Numerical stability (NaN, Inf handling tested)

2. **HNSW Index Correctness**: ✅ Recall Validated (Oct 27), 🔶 Graph Properties Partially Validated
   - [x] Recall validation against brute-force search (97-100% across all tests)
   - [ ] Graph connectivity (no orphaned nodes) - TODO: Week 7 Day 2
   - [ ] Bidirectional links verified - TODO: Week 7 Day 2
   - [ ] Layer distribution matches theory - TODO: Week 7 Day 2
   - [x] Search termination guaranteed (tested, no panics in test_hnsw_graph_properties)

3. **Binary Quantization Correctness**: ✅ COMPLETE (Oct 27)
   - [x] Hamming distance correlates with L2 distance (0.67 correlation)
   - [x] Baseline recall measured: 33.60% (expected for 1-bit quantization)
   - [x] Reranking improves accuracy (+35.4pp: 33.60% → 69.80%)
   - [x] Accuracy degradation acceptable (29x compression for 30-40% recall)
   - [x] High-dimensional (1536D) validated: 60% recall, 29.54x compression

**Validation Method**:
- Compare against numpy/scipy reference implementations
- Test on standard datasets (SIFT, GIST, etc.)
- Validate recall curves match literature
- Cross-check with other HNSW implementations

### MVCC Correctness: ✅ COMPLETE (65 tests passing)

**Test Categories**:

   - [x] Concurrent transactions see correct snapshots (test_snapshot_isolation)
   - [x] No dirty reads (test_concurrent_transaction_invisible)
   - [x] No phantom reads (test_snapshot_isolation_anomaly_prevention)
   - [x] No lost updates (test_write_conflict, test_first_committer_wins)
   - [x] Serializable isolation verified (test_snapshot_isolation_anomaly_prevention)
   - [x] Read-your-own-writes (3 tests across visibility/transaction/storage)

2. **Crash Recovery**: ✅ VALIDATED (8 WAL recovery tests)
   - [x] All committed data survives crash (test_wal_recovery_transactions)
   - [x] No uncommitted data survives (test_wal_recovery_with_rollback)

   - [x] Partial write handling (test_wal_recovery_partial_write)
   - [x] Error handling (test_wal_recovery_error_handling)
   - [x] Checkpoint integration (test_wal_recovery_with_checkpoint)

3. **Edge Cases**: 🔶 Partial Coverage
   - [x] Transaction abort and rollback (test_rollback_clears_buffer, test_wal_recovery_with_rollback)
   - [x] Concurrent updates to same row (test_write_write_conflict)
   - [ ] Large transactions (>1M rows) - TODO: Stress testing phase
   - [ ] Long-running transactions - TODO: Stress testing phase

**Validation Status**:
- ✅ Snapshot isolation fully validated (65 tests)
- ✅ Crash recovery fully validated (8 WAL tests)
- 🔶 Stress testing deferred to Phase 2 (large transactions, long-running)

### Data Persistence Correctness: 🔶 Partial Coverage

   - [x] 4175x performance improvement validated (96-122ms → <1ms)
   - [ ] Loaded graph matches saved graph (structure) - TODO: Week 7 Day 2
   - [ ] Query results identical before/after save/load - TODO: Week 7 Day 2
   - [ ] No data corruption on disk - TODO: Week 7 Day 2

- Graph serialization roundtrip (save/load/verify)
- Large/long-running transaction stress tests (deferred to Phase 2)

**Phase 2-6 Pending** ❌:
- Edge case & failure testing (resource exhaustion, invalid input, concurrency)
- Independent performance verification
- Code quality audit (clippy, unsafe code review, error handling)
- Security audit (input validation, auth, crypto, DoS prevention)
- Production readiness (monitoring, config, deployment, docs)
- Real-world usage (internal → private beta → public beta)

---

**Next Steps**: Begin Phase 1 validation (Weeks 7-8)
**Focus**: Correctness first, performance second, marketing NEVER (until validated)
**Mantra**: "Slow is smooth, smooth is fast. Databases can't afford to rush."
