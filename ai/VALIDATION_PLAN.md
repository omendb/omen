# OmenDB Validation & Quality Plan

**Date**: October 27, 2025
**Status**: Week 6 Complete - VALIDATION PHASE (NOT Marketing Phase)
**Critical**: AI-generated database requires extensive verification before production use

---

## Core Principle: Verify Everything

This is an AI-assisted codebase. Before ANY public launch or marketing:
1. Comprehensive testing and validation
2. Code quality and security audit
3. Edge case and failure testing
4. Real-world correctness validation
5. Performance validation (not just claims)
6. Peer review by experienced engineers

**Timeline**: 4-8 weeks of rigorous validation BEFORE considering launch

---

  - **Result**: ZERO memory safety issues detected
  - Use-after-free: ✅ None detected
  - Buffer overflows: ✅ None detected

   - Non-deterministic parallel building
   - Lifetime management (Box::leak usage)

2. **Binary Quantization**:
   - Numerical stability
   - Information loss acceptable
   - Reranking correctness

3. **MVCC Implementation**:
   - Snapshot isolation guarantees
   - WAL replay correctness
   - Concurrency control

4. **Serialization/Deserialization**:
   - Data corruption risks
   - Version compatibility
   - Partial write handling

### Medium-Risk Areas

1. **RocksDB Integration**:
   - Well-established library
   - But usage patterns matter
   - Monitor for issues

2. **PostgreSQL Wire Protocol**:
   - Complex protocol
   - Many edge cases
   - Compatibility testing needed
