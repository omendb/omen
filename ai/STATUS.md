---

## ✅ Week 1-2 Complete: Vector Search Validation

### Week 1: ALEX Vector Prototype (FAILED ❌)
- ✅ Research + design + prototype complete
- ✅ Memory: 6,146 bytes/vector (excellent)
- ✅ Latency: 0.58-5.73ms (17-22x faster)
- ❌ **Recall: 5%** (target 90%, CATASTROPHIC FAILURE)
- **Root cause**: 1D projection loses 99.7% of information

### Week 2 Day 1-2: HNSW Baseline (SUCCESS ✅)
- ✅ hnsw_rs integration (MIT license, production-ready)
- ✅ HNSWIndex wrapper (M=48, ef_construction=200, ef_search=100)
- ✅ VectorStore integration with lazy initialization
- ✅ 14 tests passing (6 HNSW + 4 PCA + 4 types)

**Benchmark Results** (10K vectors, 1536D):
- ✅ **Recall@10**: 99.5% (exceeds 95% target)
- ✅ **Latency p95**: 6.63ms (< 10ms target)
- ✅ **Latency p99**: 6.74ms
- ✅ **Insert**: 136 vectors/sec
- ✅ **Exact match**: 100% (distance 0.000000)

**Files**:
- `src/vector/hnsw_index.rs` (220 lines)
- `src/vector/store.rs` (245 lines, updated)
- `src/bin/benchmark_hnsw.rs` (133 lines)

**Verdict**: Production-ready HNSW baseline in 2 days ✅

### Week 2 Day 2: PCA-ALEX Moonshot (FAILED ❌)

**Hypothesis**: PCA (1536D → 64D) + ALEX → >90% recall with memory efficiency.

**Implementation**:
- ✅ Custom PCA (power iteration, no LAPACK):
  - 322 lines, 4 tests passing
  - 99.58% variance explained
  - 0.0738ms p95 projection latency
  - 14,607 projections/sec
- ✅ PCA-ALEX integration:
  - 64D PCA projection
  - First component as ALEX key
  - Range query + exact refinement
  - 3 tests passing

**Benchmark Results** (10K vectors):
- ❌ **Recall@10**: 12.4% (vs target 90%)
- ✅ Latency p95: 0.30ms (2.3x faster than HNSW)
- ✅ Build time: 16.89s

**Comparison**:
- Week 1 (1D proj): 5% recall
- Week 2 (64D PCA → 1D key): 12.4% recall
- Marginal improvement, still unusable

**Root Cause**: Collapsing 64D to 1D ALEX key loses spatial information.

**Lessons**:
- PCA works perfectly (99.58% variance)
- ALEX is fast (2.3x lower latency)
- Fundamental mismatch: ALEX 1D keys don't suit high-D vectors
- Learned indexes (LIDER/LISA) unproven vs HNSW

**Files**:
- `src/pca.rs` (322 lines, custom implementation)
- `src/vector/pca_alex_index.rs` (298 lines)
- `src/bin/benchmark_pca.rs` (160 lines)
- `src/bin/benchmark_pca_alex_vs_hnsw.rs` (251 lines)

**Verdict**: ALEX not viable for vectors. Keep for SQL only.

### Week 2 Day 2: SOTA Research (COMPLETE ✅)

**Scope**: 6-hour comprehensive analysis of vector search algorithms 2024-2025

**Report**: `docs/architecture/research/sota_vector_search_algorithms_2024_2025.md` (1,300+ lines)

**Citations**: 32+ sources (papers, blogs, benchmarks)

**Key Findings**:

**1. DiskANN (Why We Abandoned It)**
- ❌ Immutability (rebuilds on updates)
- ❌ Batch consolidation complexity
- ❌ NVMe SSD dependency
- ❌ Operational burden
- ✅ Conclusion: Smart to abandon

**2. HNSW + Quantization (Industry Standard)**
- ✅ Used by: Qdrant, Weaviate, Elasticsearch, pgvector
- ✅ 10K-40K QPS at 95% recall (ann-benchmarks.com)
- ✅ Real-time updates
- ✅ Proven at billions of vectors

**3. Binary Quantization (BQ) - Game Changer**
- ✅ 96% memory reduction (float32 → 1 bit/dim)
- ✅ 2-5x faster queries
- ✅ RaBitQ (SIGMOD 2024): Theoretical error bounds
- ✅ 95%+ recall maintained with reranking
- ✅ Production: Qdrant reports 4x RPS gains

**4. pgvector Weakness**
- No quantization support (float32 only)
- 30x memory overhead (170GB vs 5.3GB for 10M vectors)
- 10x slower (40 QPS vs 400+ with HNSW+BQ)
- **Easy to beat**

**5. Recommendation**
- ✅ HNSW + Binary Quantization
- ✅ Low risk (industry standard)
- ✅ High reward (24x memory, 10x speed vs pgvector)
- ✅ 8-week timeline

## Current Focus: Binary Quantization (Week 3-4)

**Goal**: 96% memory reduction while maintaining 95%+ recall

**Week 3 (Oct 23-30):**
- [ ] Research RaBitQ paper (SIGMOD 2024)
- [ ] Design BQ data structures
- [ ] Implement float32 → binary conversion
- [ ] Randomized threshold selection
- [ ] Two-phase search (BQ candidates → exact refinement)
- [ ] Unit tests (10+ BQ tests)

**Week 4 (Oct 31-Nov 6):**
- [ ] Integration with HNSW
- [ ] Benchmark memory reduction (target 24x)
- [ ] Validate recall >95% with reranking
- [ ] Measure query speedup (target 2-5x)

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ 95%+ recall maintained
- ✅ 10M vectors in ~15GB (vs 170GB)
- ✅ Query latency <5ms p95

---

## Strategic Decisions (Updated Oct 23)

### ✅ Validated: HNSW + Binary Quantization

**Why**:
- Industry standard (Qdrant, Weaviate, Elasticsearch)
- Our HNSW works (99.5% recall, 6.63ms p95)
- BQ proven (96% memory, 95%+ recall)
- Low risk, high reward

**Differentiation**:
- 24x memory vs pgvector
- 10x query speed
- HTAP hybrid search (unique)

**Timeline**: 8 weeks to production

### ❌ Rejected: ALEX for Vectors

**Attempts**:
- Week 1: 1D projection → 5% recall
- Week 2: PCA 64D → 1D key → 12.4% recall

**Conclusion**: Fundamental algorithm mismatch. Keep ALEX for SQL indexing only.

### ❌ Rejected: DiskANN

**Issues** (validated by research):
- Immutability + batching
- NVMe dependency
- Operational complexity

**Conclusion**: Already abandoned (smart decision)

### ✅ Focus: HTAP Hybrid Search

**Unique Advantage**:
- Vector similarity + SQL filters in one query
- Nobody else has this (Pinecone no SQL, pgvector doesn't scale)

**Example**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE category = 'electronics' AND price < 100
ORDER BY embedding <-> '[...]'::vector
LIMIT 10;
```

**Implementation**: ALEX for SQL + HNSW for vectors

---

## Competitive Position

**Current**:
- ✅ PostgreSQL compatibility
- ✅ MVCC transactions
- ✅ ALEX for SQL (28x memory)
- ✅ Crash recovery

**After BQ (Week 4)**:
- ✅ 24x memory vs pgvector
- ✅ 10x faster queries
- ✅ Same performance as Pinecone at 1/10th cost
- ✅ HTAP (unique)

**Market Position**:
- **vs pgvector**: "10x faster, 30x memory efficient"
- **vs Pinecone**: "Same performance, 1/10th cost, self-hostable"
- **vs Weaviate/Qdrant**: "PostgreSQL-compatible"
