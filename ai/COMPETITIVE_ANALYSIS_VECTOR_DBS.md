# Competitive Analysis: OmenDB vs Dedicated Vector Databases

**Date**: October 30, 2025
**Status**: Strategic planning document
**Purpose**: Assess competitive positioning and identify testing priorities

---

## Executive Summary

**Current Position**: We've validated 97x faster builds vs pgvector, but haven't tested against dedicated vector databases yet.

**Key Finding**: Qdrant (Rust-based) is the performance leader among dedicated vector DBs. We should benchmark against them first.

**Recommendation**: Focus on **Qdrant comparison** as our primary competitive benchmark, with LanceDB and Weaviate as secondary targets.

## OmenDB Current State

### What We Know (100K vectors, 1536D, M=16, ef_construction=64):

**Build Performance**:
- OmenDB: 31.05s (3220 vec/sec)
- pgvector: 3026.27s (33 vec/sec)
- **Advantage: 97x faster**

**Query Performance**:
- OmenDB p95: 6.16ms (~162 QPS at p95 latency)
- pgvector p95: 13.60ms (~73 QPS)
- **Advantage: 2.2x faster**

### What We DON'T Know:

1. ❌ **Build speed vs Qdrant/Milvus**: Are we competitive at indexing?
2. ❌ **QPS under load**: What's our max throughput with parallel queries?
3. ❌ **Latency at scale**: How do we perform at 1M, 10M, 100M vectors?
4. ❌ **Filtered search**: Metadata filtering performance
5. ❌ **Memory efficiency**: RAM usage vs competitors
6. ❌ **Profiling data**: Where are our bottlenecks?

---

## Competitive Gaps Analysis

### Where We're Likely Strong:

1. ✅ **Build speed**: 3220 vec/sec (97x faster than pgvector)
2. ✅ **PostgreSQL compatibility**: Unique differentiator vs pure vector DBs
3. ✅ **Embedded deployment**: No separate infrastructure needed
4. ✅ **Rust implementation**: Memory safety + performance (like Qdrant, LanceDB)

### Where We Need Validation:

1. ⚠️ **Query throughput (QPS)**:
   - Qdrant: 2200 QPS max, 626 QPS @ 99.5% recall
   - OmenDB: Unknown (single query p95: 6.16ms suggests ~162 QPS ceiling)
   - **Gap: Potentially 3-13x slower than Qdrant**

2. ⚠️ **Parallel query handling**:
   - Haven't tested concurrent queries
   - No benchmarks with 10, 100, 1000 parallel clients

3. ⚠️ **Filtered search**:
   - No metadata filtering benchmarks
   - Qdrant: <10% overhead, others: 30-50% slowdown

4. ⚠️ **Scale validation**:
   - Tested: 100K, 1M on Mac
   - Need: 10M, 100M, 1B benchmarks

### Where We're Likely Behind:

1. ❌ **Distributed deployment**: Qdrant/Milvus support clustering, we don't
2. ❌ **Cloud-native features**: No multi-tenancy, sharding, replication yet
3. ❌ **Ecosystem**: No client libraries, limited integrations
4. ❌ **Maturity**: Competitors have years of production testing

## Testing Strategy & Priorities

### Phase 1: Quick Validation (1-2 days)

**Target: Qdrant** (easiest to test, performance leader)

**Why Qdrant First**:
1. Rust-based (direct comparison)
2. Performance leader (hardest benchmark)
3. Easiest to deploy (Docker single-node)
4. Good documentation

**Test Setup**:
```bash
docker run -p 6333:6333 qdrant/qdrant
```

**Benchmarks** (100K vectors, 1536D):
- [x] Build time
- [ ] Single query latency (p50, p95, p99)
- [ ] QPS under load (1, 10, 100 parallel clients)
- [ ] Memory usage
- [ ] Disk usage

**Expected Outcome**:
- Build: Qdrant likely faster (focus on queries)
- Query latency: We're competitive (6.16ms vs Qdrant's optimized Rust)
- QPS: Qdrant likely ahead (2200 vs our unknown)

### Phase 2: Embedded Comparison (2-3 days)

**Target: LanceDB** (direct embedded competitor)

**Why LanceDB**:
1. Rust-based embedded architecture (direct comparison)
2. Similar use case (embedded vector DB)
3. Growing adoption

**Benchmarks**: Same as Qdrant

### Phase 3: Enterprise Comparison (3-5 days)

**Targets: Milvus, Weaviate**

**Why Later**:
- More complex setup (distributed systems)
- Different use case (enterprise scale vs embedded)
- Less relevant for our initial positioning

### Phase 4: Pinecone (Cloud-Only)

**Why Last**:
- Proprietary cloud service (not self-hosted)
- Hard to benchmark fairly (network latency)
- Different target customer

## Profiling Plan

### Tools to Use:

1. **CPU Profiling**: `cargo flamegraph`
   ```bash
   cargo install flamegraph
   cargo flamegraph --bin benchmark_pgvector_comparison -- 100000
   ```

2. **Memory Profiling**: `heaptrack` or `valgrind --tool=massif`
   ```bash
   heaptrack ./target/release/benchmark_pgvector_comparison 100000
   ```

3. **Perf Analysis**: `perf record` + `perf report`
   ```bash
   perf record -g ./target/release/benchmark_pgvector_comparison 100000
   perf report
   ```

4. **Benchmarking**: `criterion` for micro-benchmarks
   - Distance calculations
   - HNSW traversal
   - Serialization

### Expected Bottlenecks:

1. **Distance calculations** (L2, cosine):
   - SIMD opportunities (AVX2, AVX-512)
   - Batch processing

2. **HNSW traversal**:
   - Cache misses
   - Branch mispredictions

3. **Memory allocations**:
   - Vec allocations during search
   - Temporary buffers

4. **Serialization**:
   - Already fast (4175x improvement)
   - Likely not a bottleneck

---

## Optimization Roadmap

### Quick Wins (1-3 days):

1. **SIMD distance calculations**
   - Use `simdeez` or `wide` crates
   - Expected: 2-4x speedup

2. **Reduce allocations**
   - Reuse buffers
   - Object pooling for hot paths

3. **Parallel query execution**
   - Use Rayon for concurrent queries
   - Benchmark QPS improvement

### Medium Effort (1-2 weeks):

4. **Cache optimization**
   - Prefetching hints
   - Better memory layout
   - HNSW graph hot data

5. **Query batching**
   - Batch multiple queries
   - Amortize overheads

6. **Async I/O**
   - If disk becomes bottleneck
   - Tokio-based async queries

### Long-Term (1+ months):

7. **GPU acceleration** (optional)
   - CUDA/ROCm for distance calculations
   - Massive parallelism

8. **Distributed deployment**
   - Sharding support
   - Replication

## Competitive Positioning Strategy

### Our Unique Strengths:

1. **PostgreSQL Compatibility** ⭐⭐⭐
   - Only embedded vector DB with pgvector compatibility
   - Huge ecosystem (existing tools, drivers, ORMs)
   - Drop-in replacement story

2. **97x Faster Builds** ⭐⭐⭐
   - Parallel HNSW construction (unique)
   - Rapid iteration for development
   - Fast reindexing for production

3. **Embedded + Server Modes** ⭐⭐
   - Start embedded, scale to server
   - No infrastructure complexity
   - Cost-effective

4. **Source-Available** ⭐⭐
   - Can verify/audit code
   - Community contributions
   - Self-hosting friendly

### Positioning Statement (Post-Benchmarking):

**If we're competitive with Qdrant**:
> "PostgreSQL-compatible vector database. Drop-in pgvector replacement. Qdrant-class performance with PostgreSQL compatibility. 97x faster builds, [Nx faster queries]."

**If we're slower than Qdrant but faster than pgvector**:
> "PostgreSQL-compatible vector database. 97x faster than pgvector. PostgreSQL ecosystem compatibility that pure vector DBs can't match. Perfect for teams already using Postgres."

**Honest positioning**:
- Don't claim "fastest" unless benchmarks prove it
- Lead with unique strengths (PostgreSQL compatibility)
- Be honest about tradeoffs (embedded vs distributed)

## Recommendations

### Priority Order:

1. **Week 1**: Profile OmenDB + Qdrant benchmark (understand where we stand)
2. **Week 2**: Quick optimizations + parallel query support
3. **Week 3**: LanceDB benchmark + 1M Qdrant comparison
4. **Week 4**: Document competitive position + publish benchmarks

### Success Criteria:

**Minimum**:
- Within 2x of Qdrant query latency
- Competitive build speed (already 97x vs pgvector)
- Clear PostgreSQL compatibility advantage

**Stretch**:
- Match or beat Qdrant single-query latency
- Competitive QPS (within 50% of Qdrant)
- Unique features (parallel builds, serialization)

### Risk Mitigation:

If we're significantly slower than Qdrant:
1. Focus on PostgreSQL compatibility as primary differentiator
2. Target users who need Postgres ecosystem (not pure vector DB users)
3. Roadmap aggressive optimizations (SIMD, GPU)
4. Be honest about performance vs pure vector DBs

## Next Steps

1. **Run profiling session** (today/tomorrow)
2. **Set up Qdrant for benchmarking** (1-2 hours)
3. **Run identical benchmark** (1-2 hours)
4. **Analyze results** (2-4 hours)
5. **Document findings** (1 hour)
6. **Update competitive positioning** (based on results)

**Timeline**: 2-3 days for initial competitive validation
