# Learned Database Business Plan - The Brutal Truth

**Document Date**: September 25, 2025
**Author**: Solo founder with no sales experience, no co-founder, no funding

---

## Executive Summary: The Reality

We have working technology that's 2x faster than PostgreSQL B-trees. That's impressive technically but **means nothing commercially** unless we solve:
1. Why would anyone trust a solo founder's database with production data?
2. How do we compete against companies with $100M+ in funding?
3. What prevents PostgreSQL from just adding learned indexes in 2 years?

## Competitive Landscape: What We're Really Up Against

### The Incumbents (They Will Crush Us If We're Not Careful)
- **PostgreSQL**: Free, trusted for 30+ years, massive ecosystem
- **MySQL**: Owned by Oracle, enterprise standard
- **MongoDB**: $20B market cap, 50,700 customers
- **ClickHouse**: $6.35B valuation, 2,000 customers, 100% YoY growth

### The New Players (Our Direct Competition)
- **Neon**: $104M raised, Databricks acquisition, serverless Postgres
- **PlanetScale**: $105M raised, MySQL-compatible, branching
- **Supabase**: $116M raised, Firebase alternative, massive adoption
- **Turso**: SQLite edge database, $30M raised

### What Users ACTUALLY Want (Not What We Think)
1. **Reliability** > Speed (nobody cares about 2x if it crashes)
2. **PostgreSQL compatibility** (switching costs are massive)
3. **Managed service** (nobody wants to run databases)
4. **Developer experience** (better docs, instant setup)
5. **Price** (only after all above are satisfied)

**Hard Truth**: Our 2x speedup ranks #5 on their priority list.

## Business Model Analysis: What Actually Works

### Option 1: Fully Proprietary (Pinecone Model)
**Pros**:
- Complete control, no AWS competition
- Higher margins (no open source support burden)
- Simpler business model

**Cons**:
- No community adoption
- Harder to get developers to try
- Need massive marketing budget

**Success Rate**: 10% (requires $10M+ funding immediately)

### Option 2: Open Source Core + DBaaS (MongoDB Model)
**Pros**:
- Developer adoption through open source
- DBaaS for revenue (63% of MongoDB's revenue)
- Community contributions

**Cons**:
- AWS will clone us if successful
- Long path to monetization (3-5 years)
- Need to support open source users

**Success Rate**: 20% (if we can survive 3 years)

### Option 3: Source-Available + Proprietary DBaaS (Our Best Shot)
**Strategy**:
- PostgreSQL extension: MIT licensed (for adoption)
- Standalone database: Proprietary (protect IP)
- DBaaS: Main revenue driver

**Why This Could Work**:
- Extension proves the tech (low barrier to try)
- Proprietary database prevents direct cloning
- DBaaS where we make money

**Success Rate**: 30-40% (highest probability for solo founder)

## The Realistic Path to $1M ARR

### Year 0-1: Technical Validation (NOW)
**Goal**: Prove learned indexes work in production
- PostgreSQL extension with 100 production users
- 10x performance on specific workloads
- Zero data corruption issues

**Budget**: Bootstrap ($0 external funding)
**Revenue**: $0
**Burn**: Your savings

### Year 1-2: DBaaS Launch
**Goal**: First paying customers
- Launch managed service
- Target 10 customers at $1K/month
- Focus on single use case (time-series or gaming)

**Revenue Target**: $120K ARR
**Team**: You + 1 engineer
**Funding**: Optional $500K seed

### Year 2-3: Product-Market Fit
**Goal**: Prove repeatability
- 50 customers at $2K/month average
- One killer feature competitors can't match
- 99.95% uptime proven

**Revenue Target**: $1.2M ARR
**Team**: 5 people
**Funding**: $3M Series A (if growing)

## Why We Will Probably Fail (80% Chance)

### Technical Risks
1. **Learned indexes don't generalize** beyond benchmarks
2. **Write performance** is terrible (we haven't tested this)
3. **Data corruption** under edge cases we haven't found
4. **Memory usage** explodes with real workloads

### Business Risks
1. **Nobody cares** about 2x speedup (likely)
2. **Trust barrier** too high for new database
3. **PostgreSQL adds learned indexes** (game over)
4. **Can't raise funding** as solo founder
5. **Burn out** before product-market fit

### Competition Risks
1. **Neon/Supabase** add learned indexes (they have teams)
2. **ClickHouse** enters OLTP market
3. **New startup** with $10M funding and 10 engineers

---

## Why We Might Succeed (20% Chance)

### Our ONLY Advantages
1. **First mover** in production learned databases
2. **Deep technical expertise** (you actually understand this)
3. **Nothing to lose** (they have investors to please)
4. **Niche focus** possible (pick one vertical and own it)

### The Narrow Path to Victory
1. **Pick ONE specific use case** where 10x matters
   - Financial tick data
   - Gaming leaderboards
   - IoT sensor data
2. **Build the perfect solution** for ONLY that use case
3. **Get 10 customers** who love it
4. **Expand carefully** from proven base

---

## Funding Reality Check

### As a Solo Founder
- **YC**: 10% acceptance for solo founders (vs 30% for teams)
- **VCs**: Almost none invest in solo founders
- **Angels**: Possible but need traction first

### Realistic Options
1. **Bootstrap**: Build with savings, slowest but most control
2. **Revenue-first**: Get to $10K MRR, then raise
3. **Find co-founder**: Dramatically improves odds
4. **Acquisition**: Build to sell to Neon/Supabase

---

## Go/No-Go Decision Framework

### Continue If (by October 1)
✅ Extension gets 50+ GitHub stars organically
✅ One potential customer shows genuine interest
✅ You're willing to do this for 3 years minimum
✅ You have 18 months of runway saved

### Pivot If
❌ No organic interest in extension
❌ Performance advantages don't hold with real data
❌ You need income within 12 months
❌ You hate the database market dynamics

## The Uncomfortable Truth

**Success Probability**:
- With current plan: 20%
- With co-founder: 40%
- With $2M funding: 60%
- Against funded competitors: Still only 60%

**Most Likely Outcome**:
- 2 years of work
- $200K ARR business
- Acquisition by Neon/Supabase for $2-5M
- Or shut down when PostgreSQL adds learned indexes

**Best Case (5% chance)**:
- Breakthrough performance advantage
- $10M ARR in 3 years
- $100M acquisition

**Worst Case (50% chance)**:
- Burn through savings
- No product-market fit
- Shut down in 18 months

## My Honest Recommendation

1. **Build the PostgreSQL extension** (you've already started)
2. **Launch on HN** within 30 days
3. **If <100 stars in first week**: This isn't the right idea
4. **If >500 stars**: You might have something
5. **Find a co-founder** immediately if traction exists
6. **Go proprietary DBaaS** (forget open source dreams)
7. **Raise funding** only if you hit $20K MRR

**The Reality**: You're more likely to succeed building developer tools or consulting than competing with database giants. But if you're going to do it anyway, at least go in with eyes wide open.
