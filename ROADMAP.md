### üîÆ Phase 5: Future Technologies (Q4 2026+)
**Goal: Evaluate next-generation technologies when mature**

#### Mojo Re-evaluation Criteria
- ‚úÖ Mojo reaches 1.0 stability
- ‚úÖ Production deployments exist
- ‚úÖ MLIR compilation is stable
- ‚úÖ Clear 2x+ performance advantage
- ‚úÖ We have resources for dual-stack

#### MAX Platform Evaluation
- For inference workloads only
- GPU-accelerated similarity search
- Not for core database operations

#### Decision Points
- **Q4 2026**: First evaluation of Mojo 1.0 (if released)
- **Q1 2027**: MAX platform for GPU workloads
- **Q2 2027**: Consider specialized accelerators

## Performance Targets

### Current State (September 2025)
```
Metric                  Achievement
------                  -----------
Point Lookup            41M ops/sec (1.39x baseline)
Range Query             26M results/sec (1.46x baseline)
Bulk Insert             15K records/sec
Transaction Throughput  10K txn/sec
```

### Target State (December 2025)
```
Metric                  Target (Pure Rust)
------                  ------------------
Point Lookup            200M ops/sec (5x PostgreSQL)
Range Query             100M results/sec (10x PostgreSQL)
Bulk Insert             100K records/sec
Transaction Throughput  50K txn/sec
```

### Stretch Goals (With Future Tech, 2027+)
```
Metric                  Potential
------                  ---------
Point Lookup            500M ops/sec (with Mojo MLIR)
Range Query             250M results/sec (with GPU)
Vector Search           1M vec/sec (with MAX)
```

## Technology Stack

### Core (Committed)
- **Language**: Rust
- **Storage**: RocksDB
- **SIMD**: packed_simd2
- **Parallelism**: Rayon
- **Async**: Tokio
- **API**: PyO3 (Python), Tonic (gRPC)

### Future (Evaluation Only)
- **Mojo**: Re-evaluate Q4 2026 if 1.0 released
- **MAX**: For GPU inference workloads only
- **MLIR**: When proven in production
- **WebGPU**: Browser-based acceleration

## Key Principles

1. **Ship Fast**: Use proven technology (Rust)
2. **Real Performance**: Focus on algorithms, not languages
3. **Customer First**: Build what users need
4. **Modular Design**: Keep architecture flexible
5. **Measure Everything**: Data-driven decisions

## Success Metrics

### 2025 Q4
- [ ] 1,000+ GitHub stars
- [ ] 100+ beta users
- [ ] 3 production pilots

### 2026 Q2
- [ ] 10,000+ PyPI downloads/month
- [ ] 50+ paying customers
- [ ] $500K ARR

### 2026 Q4
- [ ] 100+ customers
- [ ] $1M+ ARR
- [ ] Series A raised

## Risk Mitigation

### Technology Risks
- **Risk**: Rust performance insufficient
- **Mitigation**: Modular design allows component swapping
- **Backup**: Already proven 1.4x improvement, 5x achievable

### Market Risks
- **Risk**: Enterprises slow to adopt
- **Mitigation**: Start with startups and scale-ups
- **Backup**: Open source for adoption, enterprise for revenue

### Competition Risks
- **Risk**: Postgres adds learned indexes
- **Mitigation**: Focus on complete solution, not just indexes
- **Backup**: Best implementation wins, we're ahead

## Conclusion

OmenDB will succeed by:
1. **Shipping a working product** in pure Rust
2. **Achieving real performance gains** through better algorithms
3. **Growing with customers** rather than chasing technology
4. **Keeping options open** for future optimizations

Mojo and MLIR are exciting future technologies, but Rust gives us everything we need to build a world-class database today. We'll re-evaluate new technologies when they're production-ready and we have specific needs they solve.
